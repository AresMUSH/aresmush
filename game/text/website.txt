## Welcome
Welcome to Chontio, we are an on-line storytelling based game, utilizing Fantasy Flight Game's Star Wars system.  We use _Age of Rebellion_ as the primary source for game mechanics, AresMUSH as our game server, and lore created by the Chontio dev team as well as taken from the greater Star Wars Universe. For information about Chontio and the game, please see [[[home|our wiki]]].

## Mission Statment

The players and their characters on Chontio will help guide the Tageeri Confederation and the people of Chontio through the process of contact with the Empire, criminal syndicates, and native forces, cooperating and competing to get the Confederation to a position they want.
