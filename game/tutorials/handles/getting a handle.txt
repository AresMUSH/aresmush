Handles are created and managed through AresCentral, a social MU devoted to all things AresMUSH. This server is the central authority for handles, ensuring that handles are unique across all Ares games.

To create a handle, connect to AresCentral and make yourself a character with the name you want to use as your handle.

The ideal situation is for each player to have only one handle. Often people use their wikidot account name as their handle name. You can have more than one handle if you really want to, but it’s kind of like having multiple Facebook accounts - you’re splitting up your identity and your friends lists.
