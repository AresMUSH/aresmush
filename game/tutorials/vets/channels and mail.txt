The Ares channels and mail systems are a hybrid of the Penn and Tiny command syntax, but they attempt to support both commands wherever possible.

So for channels, you can use:

    %xcchan/who <name>%xn or %xc<alias> who%xn
    %xcchan/join <name>%xn or %xcaddcom <name>=<alias>%xn  and so on

One difference for Penn players is that you have to use one of the set aliases; you can't just type some random number of characters in the channel name.  You can set multiple aliases, though.  The default is the first 2 and 3 characters, so "Chat" would be cha <msg> and ch <msg>.  

You can change your alias for a given channel at any time using %xcchannel/alias <name>=<new alias>%xn.

For mail, you can use the one-shot %xcmail <to>=<subject>/<message>%xn (Penn style) or you can use the piece-by-piece %xcmail <to>=<subject>%xn then %xc- <message>%xn composition (MUX style).
