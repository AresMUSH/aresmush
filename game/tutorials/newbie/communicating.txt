We've talked about rounding people up to join a scene, but how do you talk to them?  There are a variety of ways to talk OOC.  Remember, OOC talk is what you as a //player// say.

%xhChannels%xn are like public chatrooms.  They are a way for many players on the game to chat with each other.  Channels have a theme, like Questions or Chat, and you can choose which ones you join.

    <Chat> Faraday waves.  "Hi everyone.  Anybody feel like a scene?"

%xhPages%xn are for private conversations.  You can page more than one person at once, but only the people you page will see the message.  (MMO players may recognize these as 'whispers' or 'tells'.)

    %% (to Harvey): Faraday says, "Hi Harvey!  Want to play?"
    
%xhMail%xn, as you might guess, is like in-game email.  You can send messages to other players even when they're not online.

%xhOOC Asides%xn are for making little side comments between poses, usually greetings and seeking clarification.  Like poses, OOC comments are only seen in the same room.

        <OOC> Faraday says, "Didn't you mean north, not south?"

%xh-- Give it a try! --%xn
    Type: %xcchannels%xn to see a list of channels and the ones you're on.
    Type: %xcque Hello!%xn to say hi.  Instead of 'que', you might need to use another alias. 
       The channels command will tell you what to type to talk on your channels.
