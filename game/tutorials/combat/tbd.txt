    combat/start [<type>]
    
2) Everyone joins combat.  You can join yourself or the organizer can join for you.  Combatant types include:  soldier, pilot, passenger, observer

    combat/join [<name>=]<combat #>/<combatant type>[/<vehicle>] - Joins someone to combat.
         combat/join #123/soldier  or   combat/join Bob=#123/pilot/Viper-123
