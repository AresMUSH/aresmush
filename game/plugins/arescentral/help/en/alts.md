# Alternate Characters

AresMUSH considers "alts" to be charactrs who are linked to your %xhplayer handle%xn (help handles).   Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read bbposts and mail notifications.  See [Handles](/help/handles) for more information.

Handles are completely optional!  Whether or not you have a player handle, if you have more than one character you must register them on the wiki:
