# AresCentral - Player Handles

Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. The handles system is in its infancy right now, but the dream is to someday provide a wealth of cross-game social features.   

For more information and help on creating your handle, see: [AresMUSH Handles Tutorial](http://aresmush.com/handles/).

Having a handle is only useful once you `link` characters to it.  This tells the game which characters on which games are yours.  Linking is optional; you can pick and choose which characters you want to link.  You will need a link code from AresCentral, as explained in the handles article above.  When you have it, you can do:

`handle/link <handle name>=<link code>`

Managing your handle is done through [AresCentral](http://arescentral.aresmush.com/).

Autospace and timezone preferences are automatically downloaded from your AresCentral character to each of your linked characters, so you don't have to set them everywhere you go.
