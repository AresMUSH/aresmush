The fate of idled-out characters is at staff's discretion, but we will take into account the wishes of the player and any other players impacted by the character's departure.  If you would like to register a preference on what happens if you ever idle out, use the %xhlastwill%xn command.

    %xclastwill <instructions>%xn
    
Sample instructions (you are not limited to these):

- Kill me off.
- Put me on the roster.
- Say I left town.
- Let (so and so's) player decide what to do with me.
