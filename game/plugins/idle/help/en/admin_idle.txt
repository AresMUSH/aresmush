The idle system lets you sweep the database for players who haven't logged in for awhile, so you can decide what to do with them.

We recommend that idled-out players be kept around *if* they've been approved.  Why?  Well, they're part of the IC world.  They might come back, and allowing their name to be re-used could mess up the game wiki references.  Database space should not be an issue unless your game is ginormous. (If it is, you can always purge people later.)

There are several idle actions available:

    Destroy - Get rid of them.  This is the default for unapproved characters.
    NPC - Mark that they're a NPC.  This is the default for approved characters.
    Gone - Mark that they've left the IC area.
    Dead - Mark that they're dead.
    Roster - Put them on the roster.
    Warn - Notify them they're in danger of idling out.
    Nothing - Give them a pass until next time.

    %xcidle/start%xn - Builds up a list of idle players.
    %xcidle/action <name>=<action>%xn - Decides what to do with someone.
        Note: If someone isn't already on the list, this will add them.
    %xcidle/queue%xn - Review everyone's actions.
    %xcidle/execute%xn - Takes care of the actions and posts a summary to the BBS.
