# Idle Characters

The fate of idled-out characters is at the game admin's discretion, but we will take into account the wishes of the player and any other players impacted by the character's departure.  If you would like to register a preference on what happens if you ever idle out, use the `lastwill` command.  You could turn your character over to someone or specify that they be killed off or sent away.

`lastwill <instructions>`
