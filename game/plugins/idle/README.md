Idle
====

The Idle plugin helps you to deal with characters who have disappeared from the game.

In Ares, it is recommended that idled-out players be kept around if they've been approved.  Why?  Well, they're part of the IC world.  They might come back, and allowing their name to be re-used could mess up the game wiki references.  Database space should not be an issue unless your game is ginormous. (If it is, you can always purge people later.)

There are several idle actions available:

* Destroy - Get rid of them.  This is the default for unapproved characters.
* NPC - Mark that they're a NPC.  This is the default for approved characters.
* Gone - Mark that they've left the IC area.
* Dead - Mark that they're dead.
* Roster - Put them on the Roster.
* Warn - Notify them they're in danger of idling out.
* Nothing - Give them a pass until next time.
