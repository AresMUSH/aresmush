Tutorials
====

The Tutorials plugin supplements the Help files by providing step-by-step tutorials for more complex systems.

Built-in tutorials include:

* FS3 Combat
* Handles
* New Players
* Ares for Veteran MUSHers
* Chargen is done in a similar tutorial fashion, though it's technically a separate system.

You can also make your own.
