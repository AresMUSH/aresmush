Places
====

The places system allows you to manage large scenes by keeping track of who's where in the room.

Places code is designed to **highlight conversations at your place**, not hide conversations at other places.  You will still see everything, but poses from people at your place will automatically have a highlighted title.   This allows you to easily focus on the poses you really need to respond to, without requiring special pose commands, double poses, weird "..." mutters or other hallmarks of traditional table talk code.
