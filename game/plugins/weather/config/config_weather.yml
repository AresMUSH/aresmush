    # The temperatures are a list of all possible temperatures for that climate.
    # List as many as you want. By assigning 10 of them, we basically make it so that 
    # there's a 10% chance of each weather item coming up. If you listed 20 conditions, 
    # there would be a 5% chance for each item.
    #
    # The patterns are just a list of all possible weather conditions for that climate. 
    # Like temperature, the more you list - the more chance of each one appearing.
    # 
    # The weather stability defines the chance for the weather to *stay the same* as 
    # the current weather each time the weather cron job runs. This keeps the weather 
    # from fluctuating wildly.
