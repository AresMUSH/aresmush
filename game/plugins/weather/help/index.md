# Weather

The current IC weather for your area shows up in room descriptions, but you can see the weather across the grid using the weather command.

`weather` - Shows the weather everywhere.

## Changing the Weather

Admins and people with the 'change_weather' permission are able to change the weather for a given area.  This will last until the next normal weather change.

`weather/set <area>=<temperature>/<weather condition>`
