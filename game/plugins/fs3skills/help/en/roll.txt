This game uses the FS3 skills system.  Complete documentation can be found on the game wiki.  This is a quick reference for the commands used to make an ability roll.

    %xcroll <ability>%xn
    %xcroll <character>/<ability> - Makes a roll for someone else.
    %xcroll/private <ability>%xn - Hide results from others in the room.
    %xcroll <character>/<ability> vs <character>/<ability>%xn - Makes an opposed roll.
    
Note:  Admins can see all rolls, even private ones.  This enables them to judge scenes even when not physically present.

Typically you will roll a skill.  The aptitude value is factored in automatically based on the ruling aptitude.  (e.g. roll Firearms)

You may specify an aptitude directly if you want to use a different ruling aptitude.  (e.g. roll Firearms+Mind)

You may roll an aptitude by itself if you are defaulting to a common knowledge skill (e.g. roll Mind)

You can apply a + or - modifier.  The modifier increases or decreases your ability rating, adding or subtracting dice.  (e.g. roll Firearms-1)
