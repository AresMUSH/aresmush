To help you flesh out your character, FS3 requres you to set Goals and RP Hooks.

Goals are things that will drive your character in RP.  Are they looking for a job?  Wanting to open their own business?  Hoping to avenge their father's murder?

RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can "hook" into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you.  Looking around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP Hooks.
