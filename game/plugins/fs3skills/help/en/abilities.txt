The FS3 Abilities commands are used to set yourself up during character creation.  To get started, or at any point you wish to reset yourself, use the reset command.

    %xcreset%xn - Resets your abilities, setting default values based on your groups.
         %xh%xrThis will erase any abilities you have, so do this first!%xn

At any time you can check your current status and progress using the %xhsheet%xn and %xhapp%xn commands.

Use the Abilities command to see the ratings, available abilities and descriptions.

    %xcabilities%xn - Everything you want to know about abilities.
 
Action Skills and Advantages have ratings from 1-5.  To set them, use these commands:    
    
    %xcraise <name>%xn and %xclower <name>%xn - Raise or lower by 1 level.
    %xcability <name>=<level>%xn - Sets the rating
    
Aptitudes are special.  You get to pick 1 you're Great at, 1 you're Good at, and 1 you're Poor at:

    %xcaptitude <great ability>/<good ability>/<poor ability>%xn
    
Expertise, Interests and Languages do not have ratings.  You merely add or remove them from the list.

    %xclanguage/add <language>%xn and %xclanguage/remove <language>%xn
    Likewise for %xcexpertise%xn %xcinterest%xn
