# Configuring FS3 - Skills List

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

To configure the FS3 Skills List:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.
2. Select 'FS3 Skills'.
3. Enter the skill information and click 'Save'.

## Before You Start

You should read the article [Tweaking FS3](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/tweaking-fs3/), which contains important information to help guide you in customizing your game.

## Attributes

You can configure the list of Attributes, specifying a name and description for each.

### Default Linked Attribute

This is the Attribute used by default when someone rolls a Background or Language skill and doesn't specify an Attribute.  For example, if you set this to 'Wits' then someone rolling Basketweaving will really be rolling 'Basketweaving+Wits'.

> **Note:** This only applies to Background and Language Skills.  Action Skills all specifiy their own linked Attribute.

## Action Skills

You can configure the list of Action Skills, specifying a name, description and linked Attribute for each.

You may optionally specify a list of specialties for a skill, with the names separated by commas.

> **Tip*:*  Having a lot of Action Skills is not advised.  However, if you run out of empty boxes, just save the skill list, leave the screen and come back in.  More empty boxes will be there.

## Languages

You can configure the list of Langauges, specifying a name and description for each.

### Starting Languages

You can specify the languages that everyone should start the game Fluent at, separated by commas.

> **Tip:** Make sure you allocate enough free language points in chargen to cover rating 3 (Fluent) in each starting language, otherwise the languages will count towards a character's Ability Point total.
