# FS3 - Luck

Luck Points in FS3 can be used to generate various lucky breaks.  Luck points are earned through cookies (see `help cookies`).  You can view your available luck points on your character sheet.

You can use luck points for combat, ability rolls, or other plot points at the storyteller's discretion.  See http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/luck/ for more information.

`luck/spend <reason>` - Spends luck outside of combat.
    See `help combat luck` for combat-related luck commands.
