The FS3 Abilities commands are used to set yourself up during character creation.  For more help with abilities, see http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/chargen/.

To get started, or at any point you wish to reset yourself, use the reset command.

`reset` - Resets your abilities, setting default values based on your groups.
         **This will erase any abilities you have, so do this first!**

At any time you can check your current status and progress using the `sheet` and `app` commands.

Use the Abilities command to see the ratings, available abilities and descriptions.

`abilities` - Lists abilities.

There are two ways to adjust your abilities.  All abilities use the same commands:   

`raise <name>` and `lower <name>` - Raise or lower by 1 level.
`ability <name>=<level>` - Sets the rating

Some abilities require specialization.  You can add or remove a specialty:

`specialty/add <ability>=<specialty>` or `specialty/remove <ability>=<specialty>`
