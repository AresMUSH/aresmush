This game uses the FS3 skills system.  This is a quick reference for the commands used to make an ability roll.  For more help, see http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/roll-quickref/.

`roll <ability>`
`roll <character>/<ability>` - Makes a roll for someone else.
`roll/private <ability>` - Hide results from others in the room.
`roll <character>/<ability> vs <character>/<ability>` - Makes an opposed roll.

Note:  Admins can see all rolls, even private ones.  This enables them to judge scenes even when not physically present.

Typically you will roll a skill.  The attribute value is factored in automatically based on the ruling attribute.  (e.g. roll Firearms)

You may specify an attribute directly if you want to use a different ruling attribute.  (e.g. roll Firearms+Mind)

You may roll an attribute by itself if you are defaulting to the "Everyman" ability for common knowledge (e.g. roll Mind)

You can apply a + or - modifier.  The modifier increases or decreases your ability rating, adding or subtracting dice.  (e.g. roll Firearms-1)

For NPCs, you can specify a skill rating (e.g. roll 4).  Note that the code automatically factors in an average attribute.
