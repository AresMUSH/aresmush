%xhInterests%xn represent hobbies and things your character dabbles in but isn't particularly skilled at.  

    Interests have no rating, but when you roll one it's treated as a rating 2.

%xhExpertise%xn represents things your character is good at that are not already covered by Action Skills.  This is normally used when your career skills are not action-oriented.  

    Expertise has no rating, but when you roll one it's treated as a rating 4.

Note: You don’t need to be awesome at something to have an Expertise, but if it’s just something you dabble in, it should probably be an Interest instead.
