%xhRatings%xn

Most things in FS3 are rated from 0-5.

0  Untrained / Abysmal   No ability at all in a skill. With aptitudes, this would represent a disability.
1  Learning / Poor       You’ve got some basic know-how.
2  Competent / Average   Thoroughly competent. You succeed in most routine situations.
3  Seasoned / Good       Some experience and/or talent. You can face challenging situations.
4  Expert / Great        A veteran in your field with lots of experience. You can pull through even in dire circumstances.
5  Elite / Awesome       You have mastered your field. Few can compare to your ability.

Note - Elite doesn’t mean 'best of all time'. To use a sports analogy, Elite would mean an All-Star quality player, not necessarily the greatest player who ever lived.
