summary: Jump-start your character's wiki page.

The wiki command is intended to help you create your character's wiki page.  

> Note:  You won't actually be able to create your character's wiki page until after you're approved.  As part of the approval process, you'll get the password to join the wikidot game site and will have access to edit and create pages.

The wiki command will print out part of the page template with your character information already filled in.  Just cut and paste this into the appropriate part of the template on the wiki.
