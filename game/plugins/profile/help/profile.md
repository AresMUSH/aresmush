Each character has a **character profile** showing various information.  Any IC information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

`profile <name>`  (`profile` by itself shows your own)

The basic fields in your profile will be set up as part of character creation (see `help demographics`).  You can also set custom profile fields for extra things like notes, quotes, etc.  These custom fields can display standard MUSH formatting codes (like ansi and linebreaks).  See `help formatting`.   

`profile/add <field>=<value>` - Adds or updates a custom profile field
`profile/delete <field>` - Deletes a custom profile field
`profile/edit <field>` - Snags the field into your input buffer, if
       your client allows.  (see `help edit`)

If you have a handle, people viewing your character profile will also see a link to your OOC handle profile (see `help handles` for more info.)
