Each character has a **character profile** showing various information.  Any IC information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

`profile <name>`  (`profile` by itself shows your own)

You can set custom profile fields, which can display standard MUSH formatting codes (like ansi and linebreaks).  See `help formatting`.   

`profile/add <field>=<value>` - Adds or updates a custom profile field
`profile/delete <field>` - Deletes a custom profile field
`profile/edit <field>` - Snags the field into your input buffer, if
       your client allows.  (see `help edit`)

If you have a handle, people viewing your character profile will also see a link to your OOC handle profile (see %xhhelp handles` for more info.)
