Your profile is used to view OOC information about other characters. 

Each character has a %xhcharacter profile%xn that is unique to that particular game.  If you have an OOC player handle then you also have a %xhhandle profile%xn that is constant across all of your characters.  Whether other people can see this profile depends on your handle privacy settings (see %xhhelp handles%xn for more info.)

    %xcprofile <name or handle>%xn

You can set custom profile fields, which can display standard MUSH formatting codes (like ansi and linebreaks).  See %xhhelp formatting%xn.   

    Note: When you set up custom profile fields on AresCentral, they apply to 
          your handle profile.  When you set them on other games, they apply
          only to that character's profile.

    %xcprofile/add <field>=<value>%xn - Adds or updates a custom profile field
    %xcprofile/delete <field>%xn - Deletes a custom profile field
    %xcprofile/edit <field>%xn - Snags the field into your input buffer, if
       your client allows.  (see %xhhelp edit%xn)
