Experience Points (XP) are used to improve your character after chargen.  FS3 uses a very simple XP system.  Players each receive XP each week.  XP is an IC award, not an OOC one, and reflects your character's time learning/practicing/gaining experience.

You can spend XP to raise skills and languages, but not aptitudes.  Aptitudes reflect natural innate ability so you can't intentionally change them.

Expertise and Advantages require special approval to change, so contact the admin via a %xhrequest%xn.  XP costs may vary.

There are limits to how many XP you can save up, and how fast you can spend them.  This prevents people from making significant leaps overnight.
