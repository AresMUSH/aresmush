# Wiki Pages

The wiki command is intended to help you create your character's wiki page.  

> **Tip:**  You won't actually be able to create your character's wiki page until after you're approved.  As part of the approval process, you'll get the password to join the wikidot game site and will have access to edit and create pages.

`wiki` - View the wiki's address.

## Character Page

If your game allows, you can auto-create a character's wiki page.  If your game does not support auto-creation, or if the page already exists, the command will print out a wiki template to your screen.  This can be copied/pasted to the wiki in whole or in part.

`wiki/char [<name>]` - Creates a wiki page for a character.

## Log Page

You can also create wiki logs for scenes run through the [Scenes](/help/scenes) system.  As with character wiki pages, this command will either auto-create the page on the wiki or present you with a template (suitable for copy/paste), depending on your game's settings.

> **Tip:**  Scene logging must be enabled for this to work.  For a private scene, make sure to do this before the scene ends, otherwise the poses will be lost.  Public scene poses are kept even after the scene ends.

`wiki/log <scene#>` - Creates a wiki page for a scene log.
