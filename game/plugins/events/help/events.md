AresMUSH integrates with Teamup Calendar (http://www.teamup.com/), an app for managing events online.  You can access the full game calendar from the web (see the `events` command or the game wiki for a link) or a mobile app. 

The game provides a limited view of upcoming events. 

`events`  - Lists upcoming events
`event <#>` - Views an event

Note: It may take a few minutes before an event added online appears in the game.  If you make a change on the web page and want it to show up right away, use `events/refresh`.
