# Viewing  Jobs

> **Permissions Requred:** Working with jobs requires the access_jobs permission.

The jobs list shows you the jobs. 

`jobs` - Lists jobs
`job <#>` - Views a job.

## Filtering  Jobs

You can change what jobs you see in the jobs list.  If you're a coder, you could set your filter to only show jobs in the CODE category.  Or you might set the filter so it only shows jobs that are assigned to you.

> **Tip:** Your job filter is remembered when you log out.

Valid filters are:

* Active - Jobs that are open and/or have new activity since you last looked.  This is the default filter.
* All - All jobs, open or closed.
* Mine - Jobs that are open and assigned to you.
* (Category Name) - Jobs in the given category.

`jobs/filer <flter>` - Filters the jobs list.
`jobs/all`, `jobs/mine`, `jobs/active` - Shortcuts for the common filters.
