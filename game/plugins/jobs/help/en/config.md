# Configuring the Jobs System

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

To configure the Idle plugin:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select Advanced Config.
3. Edit `config_jobs.yml`

## Job Categories

The jobs system comes with a set of default categories, but you can add more.

> **Important!** Adding categories is fine.  If you change or delete categories, you need to update any code that was using the old category name.  For example, the chargen code uses the "APP" category when an application is submitted.

* APP - Character applications
* BUILD - Build requests.
* BUG - Bug reports.
* CODE - Code requests.
* MISC - Anything else.
* REQ - Player request.
* RP - Plot/RP related.

### Request Category

This is the category used for player requests.

## Status

The status values define your workflow.  The default workflow is:

NEW -> OPEN -> HOLD (if necessary to pause a job) -> DONE

You can add more status steps to your workflow.

> **Important!** Adding new status values is fine.  If you change or delete existing status values, you need to check to see if any code is using the old status.  For example, the chargen system allows you to configure which status a job goes to when an application is rejected or re-submitted.

### Status Color

You can also set a color for each job.  This can be changed at will.  For example, NEW jobs are green by default:

        NEW:
            color: "\%xg"

### Special Status Values

The jobs system has two special status values: 

* `default_status` - This is the status that all brand new jobs are first assigned.
* `closed_status` - Jobs with this status are assumed to be closed and do not show up on the current jobs list.  You need to use the jobs/all command to see them.
