The Jobs system allows you to track admin work assignments.

    %xcjobs%xn - Lists active jobs.
    %xcjob <#>%xn - Views a job.

Jobs can be created by players using the %xhrequest%xn command, or by automated systems through code (like when a character app is submitted).  Admin can also create jobs manually.

    %xcjob/create <category>=<title>/<description>%xn - Creates a new job
       also %xc+job/create <category>/<title>=<description>%xn
       also %xc+job/create <title>=<description>%xn (defaults to REQ type)

It's good to assign jobs to individual staff members so that nothing falls through the cracks, and people know who to contact if they have questions.

    %xcjob/assign <#>=<player>%xn - Assigns a job
    %xcjob/handle <#>%xn - Assigns a job to yourself
    
There are two ways for admins to comment upon a job.  A %xhdiscussion%xn comment is for admin eyes only, and will not ever be seen by the original submitter.  A %xhrespond%xn comment is viewable by the submitter.

    %xcjob/discuss <#>=<comment>%xn - Comments on a job (only admins may view)
    %xcjob/respond <#>=<message>%xn - Comments on a job (admins and submitter may view)
    
When you're done with the job, close it and it will be archived.

    %xcjob/close <#>%xn - Closes a job
    %xcjob/close <#>=<message>%xn - Closes a job with a comment to the original submitter.

Once a job is closed, you will only see it if it has new activity or you use the /all option:

    %xcjobs/all%xn - Lists all jobs, even closed ones.  Note: When doing multiple pages, you
        put the number before the slash, like jobs2/all

You can change various attributes about the job.
    
    %xcjob/status <#>=<status>%xn - Changes job status.
    %xcjob/cat <#>=<category>%xn - Changes job category.
    %xcjob/title <#>=<title>%xn - Changes job title.
