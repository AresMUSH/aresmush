Jobs
====

Inspired by [Anomaly Jobs](https://code.google.com/p/anomalyjobs/), the Ares jobs system lets you track admin tasks and player requests.

The Ares jobs tracker is a much more lightweight version of Anomaly, but supports a similar syntax for the bits they share in common.  Admins can handle and comment upon jobs.  Comments can be shown to the player or restricted to admins-only.

Closed jobs remain in the archive until you expressly delete them, which should not be necessary unless you end up with a gigantic amount of jobs.  This lets you reference old jobs.  (More job search features will come in future versions of Ares.)
