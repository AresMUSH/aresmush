Admins can set other people's group information.

`group/set <char>=<type>/<value>` - Sets a character's value for a group type.
        For example:  group/set Faraday=position/Cowboy
        Leave the value blank to clear it.
      Note that the shortcut commands (faction Red, position Cowboy) don't work when setting other peoples' information.
