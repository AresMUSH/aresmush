Admins can set other people's group information.

    %xcgroup/set <char>=<type>/<value>%xn - Sets a character's value for a group type.
        For example:  group/set Faraday=position/Cowboy
        Leave the vaule blank to clear it.
        
    Note that the shortcut commands (faction Red, position Cowboy) don't work when setting other peoples' information.
