Instead of having separate systems for "faction" and "position" and whatnot, AresMUSH treats these all as %xhGroups%xn.  The exact groups will vary on each game, so use the 'groups' command to see the list.  

During chargen, you should set your affiliation for each group unless you're sure it doesn't apply to your character. Only admin may change your groups after you've been approved.

    %xcgroups%xn - Lists groups.
    
To view a group or set your affiliation:

    %xcgroup <name>%xn - Describes a group and shows valid values.
    %xcgroup/set <group>=<value>%xn - Sets your affiliation.
        Leave the value blank to clear it.

Most groups have shortcuts, so if there was a Position group, there would be commands like %xhpositions%xn to list all of the items in the "Position" group and %xhposition <name>%xn to set your position.
