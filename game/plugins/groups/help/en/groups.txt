Instead of having separate systems for "faction" and "position" and whatnot, AresMUSH treats these all as %xhGroups%xn.  The exact groups will vary on each game, so use the 'groups' command to see the list.  

During chargen, you should set your affiliation for each group unless you're sure it doesn't apply to your character. Only admin may change your groups after you've been approved.

    %xcgroups%xn - Lists groups.
    %xcgroup <name>%xn - Describes a group and shows valid values.
    %xcgroup/set <group>=<value>%xn - Sets your affiliation.
        Leave the vaule blank to clear it.
