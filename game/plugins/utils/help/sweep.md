The sweep command can be used to see what disconnected players are in your room.  You can also kick them out to keep them from connecting into the middle of a private scene.  Kicking will also remove players who are more than an hour idle.

`sweep` - Show disconnected players.
`sweep/kick` - Kick disconnected and idle players outside.
