# Notes

You cannot set attributes in AresMUSH the way you can on other MU* servers.  The database works completely differently.  But you can record notes using the in-game notes system.

`notes` - Shows your notes.
`note/add <name>=<text>` - Create or update a note.
`note/delete <name>` - Deletes a note.
