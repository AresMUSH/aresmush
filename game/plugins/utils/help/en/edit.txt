AresMUSH doesn't support the old %xh/grab object/attribute%xn syntax you may be familiar with from Penn and TinyMUX, because its database works differently.  However, many commands support an /edit switch, which allows you to easily grab game text into your client's input buffer (the place where you type).  For example, typing %xhdesc/edit me%xn will put your description into your input buffer so you can edit it and send it right back.

The edit feature only works if your MU client supports grab/FugueEdit functionality.  When the client sees text with a special prefix in front, it sends the text to your input buffer instead of to your screen.  

The default prefix is `FugueEdit >`, a long-standing MUSH tradition.  This will work by on many clients, but some require you to set a different prefix (sometimes called a "grab password").  To do this:

    %xcedit/prefix <prefix>%xn - Sets your grab/edit prefix.
    
Some clients also require special setup.  See http://aresmush.com/clients for more information.
