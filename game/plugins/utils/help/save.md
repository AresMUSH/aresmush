# Save and Recall Text

The save and recall commands are handy when you're in the middle of typing something and need to save it for a moment to do something else - like answer a page or respond on channel.  You can `save` the text you were typing, do something else, and then `recall` the text when you're done.

As long as your client is set up to support input grabbing, the recall command will put the text straight into your client's input buffer (where you type).  See `help edit` for more info.

`save` - Saves some text for later.  You can have five things saved.
`recall` - Lists the text available for recall.
`recall <#>` - Recalls some text into your input buffer.
