Utils
====

The Utils plugin is a dumping ground for a bunch of minor miscellaneous commands.

Some of the things in the Utils plugin are:

* Alias
* Autospace (to automatically add blank lines or other spacers between poses)
* Echo (aka 'think')
* Save and Recall to stash poses so you can answer a page or do some other command, then retrieve it.
* Sweep
* etc.
