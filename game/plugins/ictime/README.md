IC Time
====

The IC Time plugin lets you configure your game's IC time.

The out-of-the-box IC time system follows IC time at a 1-to-1 ratio, but lets you shift it by a number of years and a number of days.  So if it's 1/1/2015 and you shift it by 200 years + 3 days you'd make it 1/4/2215.

    The IC time is Fri May 30, 2014  8:26am.
    
    Time passes at a 1:1 ratio compared to RL.
