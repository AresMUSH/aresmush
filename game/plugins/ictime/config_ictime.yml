# The IC time system mirrors the OOC server time at a 1:1 ratio.  You can adjust the
# year and day.
ictime:

    # Set this to a positive or negative number to add or subtract years from the current
    # OOC server time.
    year_offset: 0
    # After the year offset is taken into account, this number of days will be added to 
    # or subtracted from the new date.   An example of when you might want to do this is
    # if you launch your game in Janurary but want the game to ICly start in summer.  You
    # could set this offset to be around 180 days to shift the time by 6 months.
