Bulletin Boards

Inspired by the widely-loved [Myrrdin's  Bulletin Board System](http://www.firstmagic.com/~merlin/mushcode/mc.bb.html), the Ares BBS provides MU-wide discussion forums.

The Ares BBS system preserves most (if not all) of the standard Myrrdin syntax using shortcuts, so familiar commands like 'bbread', 'bbpost', etc. will still work.  But it also provides a set of commands consistent with the Ares command style, like 'bbs/new', 'bbs/post', etc.

Some other miscellaneous features:

* Board permissions tie into the Roles plugin, allowing you to define which roles can read and write to each board.
* You can reply to board posts.  Replies are shown inline with the original post.
* Admins can archive bbs posts to a wikidot format for offline archiving.
