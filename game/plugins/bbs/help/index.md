# Bulletin Board

Inspired by the widely-loved [Myrrdinâ€™s Bulletin Board System](http://www.firstmagic.com/~merlin/mushcode/mc.bb.html), the Ares BBS provides MU-wide discussion forums.

## Quick Reference - Common Commands

> **Tip:** For all of the bbs commands, you can specify either the board name or number.  Those familiar with Myrddin's BBS should find that the commands you're used to (bbread, bbpost, etc.) also work here.

`bbs` - Lists available boards.
`bbs <board>` - Lists posts on the selected board.
`bbs <board>/<post #>` - Reads the selected post.
`bbs/post <board>=<title>/<body>` - Writes a new post.
