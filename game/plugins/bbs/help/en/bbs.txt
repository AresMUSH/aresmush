The bulletin board system lets you stay posted on game news and events.  There are various %xhboards%xn available, each with a different purpose.

For all of the bbs commands, you can specify either the board name or number.  Those familiar with %xh%xcMyrddin's BBS%xn from other MUSH systems should find that the commands you're used to (bbread, bbpost, etc.) also work here.

    %xcbbs%xn - Lists available boards.
    %xcbbs <board>%xn - Lists posts on the selected board.
    %xcbbs <board>/<post #>%xn - Reads the selected post.

To quickly read new posts and replies, you can use the bbs/new command.

    %xcbbs/new%xn - Reads the first unread message.
    %xcbbs/catchup <board>%xn - Marks all unread messages as read.

On boards that you are allowed to write to, you can post a new message or reply to an existing message.

    %xcbbs/post <board>=<subject>/<body>%xn - Writes a new post.
    %xcbbs/reply <reply>%xn - Replies to the last post you read.
    %xcbbs/reply <board>/<post #>=<reply>%xn - Writes a comment as a reply to a post.

You can also edit or delete your own posts.  Currently there is no way to edit or delete replies.

    %xcbbs/edit <board>/<post #>%xn - Grabs the existing post text into your input 
       buffer (if your client supports it.  See %xhhelp edit%xn.)
    %xcbbs/edit <board>/<post #>=<new text>%xn - Replaces post text with the new text.
    %xcbbs/delete <board>/<post #>%xn - Deletes a post
    %xcbbs/move <board>/<post #>=<new board>%xn - Moves a post from one board to another.
