# BBS - Replying to Posts

The BBS system lets you carry on a thread of conversation by replying to posts.  Replies show up underneath the original post when you read it.

To reply to a message, use the board name/number, post number and your response: `bbs/reply 3/4=My reply.`

If you've just read a post, you can reply to it without specifying the name and number.  Just give a message and it will reply to the last post you've read: `bbs/reply My reply.`

## Deleting Replies

You cannot edit a reply once it's been posted, but you can delete it and try again.  Use the deletereply command with the board, post and reply number:  `bbs/deletereply 3/4=1`

Board administrators with the **can\_manage\_board** permission are able to delete other people's replies.
