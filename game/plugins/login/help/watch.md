The game can tell you when people have connected and disconnected by saying: "SoAndSo has connected."  You can turn these messages on or off, or have it only notify you when your friends come and go. See `help friends` for more info on managing your friends list.

`watch <all, none, friends>` - Whose connect messages do you see.
