# Booting Trolls

Because Ares allows anyone to connect or even create a new character from the login screen, sometimes you'll have trolls who stop by just to spam or harass everyone.  If that happens on your game, you can kick them off using the `boot` command.

By default, all approved characters can use the boot command.  However, all uses are logged and will generate a staff job.  You can add comments to that job if you need to explain why you had to boot someone.  You can paste in any offensive statements that were made so they're on record.  See [Requests](help/jobs/requests) for more information.
