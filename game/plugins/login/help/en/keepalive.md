# Keeping Your Connection Alive

Some routers get fussy if you don't do something on the connection periodically.  You can have your client periodically send a command that does absolutely nothing but will keep the connection alive.

[[help keepalive]]

In addition, AresMUSH automatically sends a message to your client periodically to keep the connection open from the other direction.  You can turn this off.
