# Connecting and Disconnecting

To get past the game's welcome screen, you need to log in with a character.  

## Touring with a Guest Character

There are a number of 'guest' characters available that you can borrow just to log in and look around.  To use one of them, type:

`tour`

## Connecting to a Character

Once your character is created, you can connect to them from the login screen.  For help creating a character see [Creating a Character](/help/login/create).

`connect <name> <password>`

## Quitting the Game

When you're done, you can quit.

`quit` - Disconnects from the game.
