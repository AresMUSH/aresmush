# Connecting and Disconnecting

To get past the game's welcome screen, you need to log in with a character.  

## Touring with a Guest Character

There are a number of 'guest' characters available that you can borrow just to log in and look around.  To use one of them, type:

`tour`

## Creating a Character

When you're ready, you'll want to create your own character.  Your character name can be your first or last name.  Multi-word names are not permitted.  You should take care to consider the game's theme when choosing your name.  

`create <name> <password>` - Creates a character.

## Connecting to a Character

Once your character is created, you can connect to them from the login screen.

`connect <name> <password>` - Connects to a character.

## Quitting the Game

When you're done, you can quit.

`quit` - Disconnects from the game.
