# Creating a Character

When you're ready, you'll want to create your own character.  Your character name can be your first or last name.  Multi-word names are not permitted.  You should take care to consider the game's theme when choosing your name.  

`create <name> <password>`

## Changing Your Name

Up until the point when you're approved, you can change your name.

`name <new name>`

After you're approved, only admins can change your name.  This is because changing your identity may confuse people, and may mess up thinks like wiki page references.

## Setting an Alias

A character can also have a single nickname/alias.  You can use it anywhere that you use a character's name.

`alias <name>` - Sets your alias.  Leave blank to clear it.

## Setting Your Email

You can associate an email address with your account, to enable game admin to contact you.  This is optional, but can be helpful if the game ever goes down, or if you can't log in for awhile (so you don't get idled out).  Your email is not displayed on your public profile.

`email` - Views your registered email
`email/set <email>` - Changes the email registered with your account.
