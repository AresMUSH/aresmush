To get past the login screen, you need a character.  There are a number of 'guest' characters available that you can borrow just to log in and look around.  To use one of them, type:

`tour`

Also from the login screen, you can create a new character or connect to an existing one.  Names will normally be your character's first or last name, and can only be a single word.  You should take care to consider the game's theme when choosing your name.  

`create <name> <password>`
`connect <name> <password>`

You can change your password at any time.  If you forget your password and have a player handle (help handles), you can create a temporary one at AresCentral.  If you don't have a player handle, you'll have to log in with a guest character using the `tour` command and contact an admin.

`password <oldpassword>=<newpassword>` - Changes your password.

When you're done, you can quit.

`quit` - Disconnects from the game.
