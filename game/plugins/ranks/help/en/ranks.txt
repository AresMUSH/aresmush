Ranks are used in military or paramiltary organizations.  The Ares ranks system differentiates ranks by groups (see help groups).

    %xcranks%xn - Shows groups with ranks
    %xcranks <group>%xn - Shows ranks for a given group. 

As part of character creation, you can set your rank.

    %xcrank/set <rank>%xn - Sets your rank  (leave rank blank to clear it)
