The **Mail System** lets you send messages to players who are not online, similiar to email.

`mail` - Shows your inbox.
`mail <#>` - Reads a message in your inbox.
`mail/new` - Reads your first unread message.

Sending mail is easy. The "to" field can include any number of player names, separated by spaces. You can also forward a message from your inbox to someone else.

`mail <to>=<subject>/<message>` - Sends a message.

For advanced mail topics see:

    help mail composition - MUX-style mail writing.
    help mail review - Reviewing messages you've sent.
    help mail tags - Organizing your mail with tags.
