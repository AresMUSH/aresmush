# Mail

The **Mail System** lets you send messages to players who are not online, similiar to email.

## Quick Reference - Common Commands

`mail` - Shows your inbox.
`mail <#>` - Reads a message in your inbox.
`mail/new` - Reads your first unread message.
`mail <to>=<subject>/<message>` - Sends a message.

## Requests/Jobs and Mail

Job requests are preferred over mail as a means of communicating with the game admin.  The jobs system does not normally send you a mail message when your request is updated.  All activity is logged in the job itself.  

Admins can convert a mail mssage into a job.

`mail/job <#>` - Turns a mail message into a job request.
