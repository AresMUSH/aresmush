# Composing Mail Messages

Ares also supports MUX-style mail composition, which lets you write your mail in pieces instead of all at once.

`mail <to>=<subject>` - Starts a mail.
`-<message>` - Adds a new paragraph to a message.
`mail/proof` - Shows your mail so far.
`mail/send` or `--` - Sends the mail.
`mail/toss` - Throws away the message you were drafting.
