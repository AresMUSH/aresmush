Instead of folders, Ares mail uses %xctags%xn, which are a sort of label used to organize your mail.  There are several special tags:  

    Inbox - Incoming mail.
    Sent - If you've enabled the sent-mail feature, saves a copy of mail you've sent.
    Trash - Mail you've marked for deletion.
    Archive - Mail you've archived to keep it from cluttering up the inbox.

You can make your own custom tags as well to organize your messages as you desire.

    %xcmail/tag <#>=<tag>%xn - Assigns a tag to a message.
    %xcmail/untag <#>=<tag>%xn - Removes a tag from a message.
    %xcmail/tags%xn - Lists all your tags.

You can filter your mail view to only show a certain tag.

    %xcmail/filter <tag>%xn - Shows mail matching the tag.  Remains in effect until you 
        switch the filter or log out.
    %xcmail/inbox, mail/sent, mail/archive or mail/trash%xn - Shortcuts to common tag views.
