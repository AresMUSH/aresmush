# Deleting and Archiving Mail

You can delete mail messages.  Technically this doesn't delete it right away, but tags it as trash.  Messages tagged as trash are deleted when you log out.

`mail/delete <#> or <start#>-<end#>` - Sends a message to the trash.
`mail/undelete <#>` - Recovers a message from the trash.
`mail/emptytrash` - Permanently deletes messages in the trash.

Instead of deleting a mail message, you can archive it.  See `help mail tags`.

`mail/archive <#>` - Clears current tags and applies the Archive tag instead.

You may want to backup your mail before deleting it.

`mail/backup` - Prints out your mail, which you can save to a log file.
