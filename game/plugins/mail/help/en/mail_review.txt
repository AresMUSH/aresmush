The mail review feature lets you see what messages you've sent, whether they've been read, and even unsend them.  Note: You can't unsend mail that's already been read.  Once someone deletes your message, it will no longer show up in the mail review list.  If you want to be able to review deleted messages, enable the sent-mail feature (see %xhhelp mail sending%xn).

    %xcmail/review <name>%xn - Shows messages you've sent to someone.
    %xcmail/review <name>/<#>%xn - Sees the details of a particular message.
    %xcmail/unsend <name>/<#>%xn - Unsends a message if it hasn't already been read.
