The %xhMail System%xn lets you send messages to players who are not online, similiar to email.

    %xcmail%xn - Shows your inbox.
    %xcmail <#>%xn - Reads a message in your inbox.
    %xcmail/new%xn - Reads your first unread message.
    
Sending mail is easy. The "to" field can include any number of player names, separated by spaces. You can also forward a message from your inbox to someone else.

    %xcmail <to>=<subject>/<message>%xn - Sends a message.
    %xcmail/fwd <#>=<to>/<comment>%xn or - Forwards a message, along with an optional comment.

Ares also supports MUX-style mail composition, which lets you write your mail in pieces instead of all at once.

    %xcmail <to>=<subject>%xn - Starts a mail.
    %xc-<message>%xn - Adds to a message
    %xcmail/proof%xn - Shows your mail so far.
    %xcmail/send%xn or %xc--%xn - Sends the mail.
    %xcmail/toss%xn - Throws away the message you were drafting.
    
You can also delete a message.  Technically this doesn't delete it right away, but tags it as trash.  Messages tagged as trash are deleted when you log out.

    %xcmail/delete <#>%xn - Sends a message to the trash.
    %xcmail/undelete <#>%xn - Recovers a message from the trash.
    %xcmail/emptytrash%xn - Permanently deletes messages in the trash.
