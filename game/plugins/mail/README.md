Mail
====

Ares features a robust in-game mail system.

Every effort has been made to support both the Penn-style mail syntax and the MUX-style (composition based) mail syntax.

Ares also has a number of additional mail features:

* Tags, instead of folders, give you a flexible way to organize your mail.
* Automatic sent mail.
* A reply and reply-all mail command.
* Mail review and un-send.
* Mailing lists (Coming Soon)
