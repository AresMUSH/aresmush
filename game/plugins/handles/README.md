Handles
====

Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. A handle is your OOC identity, used across all Ares games.  Through your handle, people can identify you as a **player**, not just as a character.

Handles have an @-sign in front to distinguish them from regular player names.  I'm @Faraday.

But why?
----

There are some MU sub-communities where the players all know each other, and we've all seen posts like "Looking for SoAndSo from SuchAndSuchMUSH."  Games close, people drift.

Handles provide tools to help you keep in touch with your friends, and keep track of who's who.

What do handles do?
----

Having a handle enables a lot of features. 

You can show your handle on channels and the who list so people know who you are.

    <Chat> Cate (@Faraday) says, "Hi everyone."

People can access your handle profile and find out about you and what characters you play.  You can do the same for your friends.  This information can be restricted (see Privacy, below).

You can add other handles as your friends and share that friends list easily on all your games.

    friend/add @Faraday --> Now I will be your friend across all Ares games.

When you log into a game, you can see if any of your friends are playing there (if their privacy settings permit).

Someday, handles might tie into more cross-game features, like being able to page people on different games (anyone remember MUDBot?)

What about my privacy?
----

Some of the handles features may make you say, "OMG I don't want people to know this about me!"  **Don't worry.**  You have full control over who can see what.

Handles are completely optional. The most extreme privacy setting is simply not to make a handle. 

You also choose which characters are **linked** to your handle, and who can see that link.   This setting is *per-character*, so you can have some public and restrict others.

* **Public** - Everyone will see this character listed on your handle profile.  Anyone can access your handle profile through your character name (e.g. 'profile Cate' will bring up the profile for @Faraday).  Your handle name will show up in certain OOC commands (like channels and who list).  

* **Friends-Only (Default)** - Only people on your friends list will see this character listed on your handle profile.  Only your friends can access your handle profile through your character name. Your handle name will NOT show up in OOC commands.  

* **Private(*)** - Nobody will see this character listed on your handle profile, or be able to access your handle profile through your character name.

> Why is there a '*' by "private"?  Because true privacy on a MUSH is an illusion.  Remember that the admins of any game you log into have have access to your IP address, the game database, and anything you type.  It's not that hard to identify alts even without handles.  AresCentral admins are bound by our [Privacy Policy](http://www.aresmush.com/privacy), but other games may not be.

How do I get a handle?
----

Handles are created and managed through AresCentral (mush.aresmush.com port 7206), a social MU devoted to all things AresMUSH.  This server is the central authority for handles, ensuring that handles are unique across all Ares games. 

To create a handle, connect to AresCentral and make yourself a character with the name you want to use as your handle. AresCentral is the only game where your character name and handle name need to be the same.  

The ideal situation is for each player to have only one handle.  Often people use their wikidot account name as their handle name.  You *can* have more than one handle if you really want to, but it's kind of like having multiple Facebook accounts - you're splitting up your identity and your friends lists.
