Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. The handles system is in its infancy right now, but the dream is to someday provide a wealth of cross-game social features.   

For more information and help on creating your handle, see: http://aresmush.com/handles/

Having a handle is only useful once you `link` characters to it.  This tells the game which characters on which games are yours.  Linking is optional; you can pick and choose which characters you want to link.  Linking is a two-step process to verify your identity on both AresCentral and the local game.  You will need a link code from AresCentral, as explained in the handles article above.  When you have it, you can do:

`handle/link <handle name>=<link code>`

Managing your handle is done through AresCentral.

Autospace and timezone preferences are automatically downloaded from your AresCentral character to each of your linked characters, so you don't have to set them everywhere you go.
