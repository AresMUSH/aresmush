Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. The handles system is in its infancy right now, but the dream is to someday provide a wealth of cross-game social features.   For more information, see: http://aresmush.com/handles/

To link a character on another game to your Handle, follow the instructions in %xchelp handle link%xn.

You can set your handle privacy *per-character*.

    %xchandle/privacy <privacy setting>%xn
    %xchandle/info%xn - View your privacy settings (and other handle information)

Autospace and timezone preferences are automatically downloaded from your AresCentral character to each of your linked characters, so you don't have to set them everywhere you go.  You can enable or disable this on an individual character using the sync command.

    %xchandle/sync <on or off>%xn
