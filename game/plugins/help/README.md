Help
====

The Help system provides in-game help files.  

You can define different help libraries, such as for admin and builder help.  And the help files are organized by category to make it easier to find things.

Note: There is no distinction between 'help' and '+help' in Ares - all commands are documented together.

**Help File**

    ==============================================================================
    Player Help: Login
    
    To get past the login screen, you need a character.  There are a number of 'guest' characters available that you can borrow just to log in and look around.  To use one of them, type:
    
        tour
        
    Also from the login screen, you can create a new character or connect to an existing one.  Names will normally be your character's first or last name, and can only be a single word.  You should take care to consider the game's theme when choosing your name.  
    
        create <name> <password>
        connect <name> <password>
        
    You can change your password at any time.  If you ever forget your password, use the 'tour' command and contact the admins.
      
        password <oldpassword>=<newpassword> - Changes your password.
        
    When you're done, you can quit.
    
        quit - Disconnects from the game.
