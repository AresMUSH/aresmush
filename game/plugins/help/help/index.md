# Help System

The MUSH help system is here to help you learn how to play.

The best way to get help is through the Web Portal.  Type `website` to get the address.

Throughout the help files, you'll find hyperlinks to other help topics.  On the Web Portal, you can just click and follow the links.  In the game, they will appear like so:  [Example](/help/login/connect) and you will have to type `help login connect` (without the slashes).

`help, help2, help3, etc.` - Shows each page of help topics.
`help <topic name>` - Views a help topic.

> **Tip:**  Many commands show a "page x of y" message at the bottom of the command text.  You can use a number after the command name to see each page - e.g., help, help2, help3, etc.
