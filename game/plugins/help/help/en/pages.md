# Multi-Page Commands

Many commands have multiple pages.  They will show a "page x of y" message at the bottom of the command text.  You can use a number after the command name to see each page - e.g., help, help2, help3, etc.  to access additional pages.

For commands with a switch, put the number **before** the switch.  For example: requests2/all.
