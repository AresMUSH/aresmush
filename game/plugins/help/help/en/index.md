# Help System

If you are looking for basic help about how the game is played, check out the [MUSH 101 Tutorial](http://www.aresmush.com/mush-101)

The MUSH help system is here to help you learn how to use the in-game commands.  You can view the help files in the game using the `help` command, or on the game's Web Portal.  The Web Portal help files are prettier and have hyperlinks that make them easier to read.  

> **Tip:** Type `website` to get the address for the Web Portal.

If you're viewing help commands inside the game, the hyperlinks will appear in plain text like: "See \[Connecting to the Game\](/help/login/connect)".  You will have to type `help login connect` (without the slashes) to view that help file.

`help, help2, help3, etc.` - Shows each page of help topics.
`help <topic name>` - Views a help topic.

> **Tip:**  Many commands show a "page x of y" message at the bottom of the command text.  You can use a number after the command name to see each page - e.g., help, help2, help3, etc.  This works with commands that have switches too, so you can do requests2/all.
