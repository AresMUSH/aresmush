The `home` command lets you return quickly to a place of your choosing on the game.  You can choose any room to be your home, IC or OOC, so your home could be your character's IC residence or the Off-stage room, or anywhere you like.  Please be considerate, though, and don't use other peoples' private rooms as your home location without asking.

`home/set` - Sets your home to your current location.
`home` - Go home.
