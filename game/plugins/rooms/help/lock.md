If you're in an interior room (defined as one with an "O" out exit), you can lock and unlock the outside door (i.e. the one leading INTO the room from the outside) for privacy.

`lock`
`unlock`

Builders can also lock exits to a list of roles - for instance if you had a "rebel" role you could lock a secret rebel exit to "rebel admin" so only rebels and admins could use it.

`lock <exit>=<list of roles who are allowed in>`
`unlock <exit>`
