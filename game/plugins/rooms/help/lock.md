# Locking Exits

If you're in an interior room (defined as one with an "O" out exit), you can lock and unlock the outside door (i.e. the one leading INTO the room from the outside) for privacy.

`lock`
`unlock`

Builders can also lock exits to a list of roles - for instance if you had a "rebel" role you could lock a secret rebel exit to "rebel admin" so only rebels and admins could use it.  This command requires the 'build' permission.

`lock <exit>=<list of roles who are allowed in>`
`unlock <exit>`
