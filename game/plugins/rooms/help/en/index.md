# The Grid

The MUSH grid consists of **Rooms** connected by **Exits**.  This is called the Grid.

The room description shows available exits and their destinations.  For example:
      [N] Green Hills
You can use the `go` command to move through an exit, or just use the exit name as a shortcut.  For example:  "go n" or simply "n".

`go <exit name>` or `<exit name>` - Move through an exit
