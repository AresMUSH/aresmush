Roles
====

Instead of flags and powers, Ares supports a generic Roles system.

You can define whatever roles you want - admin, builder, guest, stormtrooper, viper pilot, etc. and then assign those roles to players.   Commands, bulletin boards, exits, channels and more can all be restricted/locked so that only certain roles can access them.

The out-of-the-box configuration defines only one level of admin.  All admin commands are locked to that role by default.  If you have multiple levels of admin on your games, you can define new roles for them and adjust the configuration to lock commands to the appropriate levels.
