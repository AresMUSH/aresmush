The game administrators, sometimes called "admin" or "staff", are the people behind the curtain - the ones who keep the game running smoothly.  You can use the %xhadmin%xn command to see who they are. 

Please refrain from paging admins who are marked as 'off duty' unless it's an emergency.  If your problem is not immediate, you may also consider using the %xhRequest%xn system to submit a general request rather than contacting a specific admin.  This is usually better than mail because there's a record of it and requests can be handled by the first available admin.

`admin` - Shows game admins.
