You can create and delete roles.

`role/create <name>`
`role/delete <name>`

The `admin` command lists all game admins.  It automatically finds people based on whether they have one of the roles you have defined as an admin role in your game config.  

You can set yourself on and off-duty using the duty command (help duty).

You can also set a note to appear next to your name on the admins list, describing your role.

`adminnote <note>` - Sets your note.
