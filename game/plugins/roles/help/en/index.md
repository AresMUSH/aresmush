# Roles

The game administrators, sometimes called "admin" or "staff", are the people behind the curtain - the ones who keep the game running smoothly.  You can use the `admin` command to see who they are. 

> **Tip:** Please refrain from paging admins who are marked as 'off duty' unless it's an emergency.  If your problem is not immediate, you may also consider using the [Jobs](/help/jobs/index) system to submit a general request rather than contacting a specific admin.

In addition to allowing you to designate game admins, the Roles system lets you create roles and assign more fine-tuned permissions.

## Quick Reference - Common Commands
