# Scenes

While you can always do free-form RP on the grid or in the RP room, there are a variety of features available to you if you use the **Scenes** system to manage your RP scene.  Some features that the scenes system provides:

* Creating temprooms for private scenes or places not on the grid.
* Advertising your scene as public so others know they're welcome to join.
* Capture a log of poses, skill rolls and combat messages without the OOC spam.
* Share a log to the game's web portal and/or wiki (if enabled).
