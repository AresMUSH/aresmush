The events system is an in-game calendar that lets you schedule events.

`events`  - Lists upcoming events
`event <#>` - Views an event
`event/create <title>=<date>/<time>/<description>`

You can create and edit your own events.

`event/edit <#>` - Grabs the current event into your edit buffer (see help edit)
`event/update <#>=<title>/<date>/<time>/<description>`
`event/delete <#>`
