# Configuring the Game Skin (Lines)

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

To configure the game skin:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Skin / Lines'.

You can configure the border lines that are used in almost every command.  Ares lets you define four different lines, and you can use them in any template with the \%l1, \%l2, \%l3, \%l4 formatting codes.   

* l1 is the standard top/bottom line shown around command output.
* l2 is a more plain-looking line usually used as a separator under titles and between items in a list.
* l3 and l4 are not used by the default Ares code.
