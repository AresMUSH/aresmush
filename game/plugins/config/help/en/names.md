# Configuring Restricted Names

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

You can configure character names that are off-limits.  For example, if your theme is Star Wars you may want to reserve Luke and Yoda. 

To configure restricted names:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Restricted Names'.

Simply list the names one per line.  Capitalization doesn't matter.  Entering 'Yoda' will prevent yoda, yODa, YODA, and so forth.
