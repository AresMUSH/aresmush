Manage
====

The Manage plugin contains a variety of admin-only management commands.

* Shutting down the game.
* Announcing something to connected players.
* Reloading game configuration and plugins.
* Modifying objects in the database (examine, rename, destroy, etc.)
* Dealing with problem players (boot and findsite).

It is useful to note that individual plugins also provide their own admin commands.  The manage plugin commands are related to general game management.
