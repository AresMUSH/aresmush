AresMUSH recognizes alts as charactrs who are linked to a %xhplayer handle%xn (help handles).   Since handles are optional, your game may need other ways for you to declare if you have multiple characters (a request or wiki page, for instance.)

The `alts` command will show you potential alternate characters.  We say "potential" because dynamic/block IP addresses mean that some players who live geographically close to each other (including, obviously, roommates) may end up with the same host name.

`alts` - Lists potential alts.
