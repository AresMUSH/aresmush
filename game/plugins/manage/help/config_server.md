# Configuring the Server

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

To configure the server:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Advanced Config'.
3. Select `server.yml`.

Your server properties were set up initially during the game installation.  If for some reason your host or port information changes, you can edit it here.

> **Important!** Unlike other configuration settings, changing the server config requires you to shut down and then restart the game.
