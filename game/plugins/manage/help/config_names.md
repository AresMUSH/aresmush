# Configuring Restricted Names

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

To configure restricted names:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Restricted Names'.

You can configure character names that are off-limits.  For example, if your theme is Star Wars you may want to reserve Luke and Yoda.  Simply list the names one per line.  Capitalization doesn't matter.  Entering 'Yoda' will prevent yoda, yODa, YODA, and so forth.
