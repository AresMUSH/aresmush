# Configuring the Database

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

To configure the database:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Advanced Config'.
3. Select `database.yml` to edit the database URL -or- select `secrets.yml` to edit the password.

Your database was set up initially during the game installation.  If for some reason your database server changes, or you need to reset the password, you can edit the `database.yml` file directly.

> **Important!** Unlike other configuration settings, changing the database config requires you to shut down and then restart the game.
