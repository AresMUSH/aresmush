AresMUSH considers "alts" to be charactrs who are linked to your %xhplayer handle%xn (help handles).   Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read bbposts and mail notifications.

Handles are completely optional!  Whether or not you have a player handle, if you have more than one character you must register them on the wiki:
