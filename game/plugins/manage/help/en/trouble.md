# Dealing With Trouble

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the manage\_game permission.

Unfortunately, you will sometimes have to deal with troublesome players.  These commands will help.

## Booting Characters

If someone is causing a ruckus or gets stuck online or something, you can disconnect them.  See [Boot](/help/boot) for more info.

## Findsite

The findsite command will help you find characters with similar IP address, which may be alts of one another.

> **Tip:**  Many internet providers use dynamic/block IP addresses, which means that some players who live geographically close to each other (including, obviously, roommates) may end up with the same host name or IP.

`findsite` - Shows a site summary identifying possible alts.
`findsite <name, host or IP>` - Shows someone's IP address and any similar ones.

## Suspects and Bans

You can mark certain IP addresses and/or hostnames as suspect sites, or ban them completely.  See the tutorial on [Configuring the Login System](http://aresmush.com/tutorials/config/login) for details.
