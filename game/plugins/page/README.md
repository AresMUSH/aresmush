Pages allow you to communicate privately with other players.

    %% (to Faraday (Fara)): Anna says, "Hi there!"

If you don't want to be bothered by pages, you can mark yourself as 'do not disturb' and incoming pages will be routed to mail instead.   Also, if you have been idle a long time anyone who pages you will be alerted that you might be AFK.
