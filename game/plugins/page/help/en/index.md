# Pages

Pages are private messages sent between players.  You can page any number of people at once, and use the standard pose formats in the message (like : and ;).

`page <list of names>=<message>`

## Automatic AFK Notice

If you are very idle or marked Away From the Keyboard, people paging you will be notified that you may not respond right away.  You can control the specific message they receive using the 'afk' command.


## Page Format

You can customize the appearance of pages by changing the color (see `help colors`) of the %% at the beginning as well as autospace text that appears before every page (such as a blank line or other marker).

`page/autospace <text before pages>`
`page/color <ansi code>`

## Blocking Pages

If someone is annoying you so much you feel the need to block them, you should report them to the game admin.  But while you're waiting for them to deal with it, you can block the harasser by ignoring them.

`page/ignore <name>=<on or off>`

If you don't want to be bothered by pages at all, you can mark yourself as 'do not disturb' and incoming pages will be blocked with a message to the sender.

`page/dnd <on or off>`
