# Pages

Pages are private messages sent between players.  You can page any number of people at once, and use the standard pose formats in the message (like : and ;).

`page <list of names>=<message>`

You can customize the appearance of pages by changing the color (see `help colors`) of the %% at the beginning as well as autospace text that appears before every page (such as a blank line or other marker).

`page/autospace <text before pages>`
`page/color <ansi code>`

If you don't want to be bothered by pages, you can mark yourself as 'do not disturb' and incoming pages will be blocked.

`page/dnd <on or off>`

If you are very idle or marked Away From the Keyboard, people paging you will be notified that you may not respond right away.  You can control the specific message they receive using the 'afk' command.
