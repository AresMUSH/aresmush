Descriptions
====

Characters, rooms and exits all have descriptions.  The Describe plugin lets you set them.  Because it's a plugin and not part of the engine, games can easily tweak or replace the description code.  

For example, a fantasy game might restrict clothing options to what you've purchased.  A military game may include your rank and other information automatically in your desc.

The Desc plugin also includes **outfits**, aka a multi-desc or 'wear' system, and a robust **details** system that lets you set detail views on objects and easily look at them through the basic 'look' command.

The appearance of descriptions can be tweaked through the Templates system.
