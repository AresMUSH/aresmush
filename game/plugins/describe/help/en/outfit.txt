The %xhoutfit%xn command lets you manage multiple outfits for your character.  Typically you'll define one base outfit for your character's body description, and then have a variety of mix-and-match clothing outfits for your different clothes and accessories.

   %xcoutfits%xn - Lists outfits
   %xcoutfit <name>%xn - Views an outfit.
   %xcoutfit/set <name>=<description>%xn - Creates a new outfit, or replaces an old one.
   %xcoutfit/delete <name>%xn - Deletes an outfit.

You can wear a combination of outfits using the %xhwear%xn command.  This will set your description to the selected outfits.

   %xcwear <list of outfits>%xn - Wear outfits.
