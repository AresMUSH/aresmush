The roster system allows you to jump into RP more quickly with a ready-made character with ties to other players. Some characters have been pre-played, while others are former NPCs.

    %xcroster%xn - Views a list of rostered characters.
    %xcroster <name>%xn - Views details about a character.
    %xcroster/claim <name>%xn - Claims a character.  
        You will be paged with the login password.

If a character has been through chargen, you can see their stats and background using the %xcsheet%xn command. The roster system will tell you who to contact if you are interested in playing the character and want to find out more info about them, but you do not need anyone's permission to claim a roster character. Just use the roster/claim command to take them.
