The %xcapp%xn command is your friend during chargen.  You will want to check it after completing each section because it will alert you to things you may have forgotten to set.  It also references you to the relevant help files if you need to look up commands, and will show you the status of your application once you submit it for admin approval.

As the app command tells you, %xrred%xn issues will almost certainly prevent your character from being approved (like forgetting to set your eye color).  %xyYellow%xn issues might actually be OK if it fits the character concept (like not having a department set - maybe it's not applicable for you.)

%xh-- Give it a try! --%xn 

    Type: %xcapp%xn to see your current chargen status.
