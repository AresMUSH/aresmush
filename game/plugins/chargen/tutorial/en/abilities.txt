This game uses the FS3 skills system.  You can read more about FS3 on the game wiki or on aresmush.com.  In chargen you will set your character's: 

* Attributes
* Action Skills
* Background Skills
* Languages
* Quirks

If you have set your groups already, the system will automatically assign you some default skills appropriate for your group.  You are, of course, free to change them but be ready to justify removing or lowering default skills.

It is important to make sure that your background and abilities jive with one another.  That is a big thing that admins will look for during your character review.
