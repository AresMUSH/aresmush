Character creation (aka chargen) here works a little differently than what you might be used to from other games.  Instead of being a series of rooms, the %xccg%xn command will walk you through the necessary steps.  

You can go back and forth through the steps of chargen using %xccg/next%xn and %xccg/prev%xn.  Going back is always allowed, but when you go forward - the game may check to make sure you've done what you needed to do in that step.
