Admins can view and edit other character backgrounds, in case you need to make simple tweaks during the approval process.

    %xcbg/set <name>=<background>%xn - Sets your background.
    %xcbg/edit <name>%xn - Grabs the existing background text into your input 
       buffer (if your client supports it.  See %xhhelp edit%xn.)
       
You can view someone's background on their character sheet.  See %xhhelp sheet%xn.
