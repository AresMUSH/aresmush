Character creation (aka chargen) here works a little differently than what you might be used to from other games.  Instead of being a series of rooms, it is a more free-form process.  You can access the chargen commands from anywhere.

Throughout the process, you will want to check your progress and the things you've set:

    %xhhelp sheet%xn - Character sheet.
    %xhhelp app%xn - Check your progress.
    
Here is the recommended flow for chargen, but you can do them in any order and skip around to your heart's content:

1. %xgDemographics%xn - Setting your basic information like full name, height, age, etc.  (%xhhelp demographics%xn)

2. %xgGroups%xn - Setting your affiliations for things like factions, organizations, positions, etc.  (%xhhelp groups%xn) 

3. %xgBackground%xn - Your character's backstory, or biography.  (%xhhelp bg%xn)

4. %xgAbilities%xn - Attributes, skills and more.  (%xhhelp abilities%xn)
    Note:  It is recommended that you do your groups before your ablities, because then the system can set you up with initial recommended skills.

5. %xgDescription%xn - You'll want to describe yourself.  (%xhhelp describe%xn)

6. %xgActor%xn - You may want to pick an actor to represent your character.  (%xhhelp actor%xn)

7. %xgReview%xn - Submit your character application for review by staff.  (%xhhelp app%xn)
