Character creation (aka chargen) here works a little differently than what you might be used to from other games.  Instead of being a series of rooms, it is a multi-step tutorial that guides you through the necessary setup.  

To start chargen, type %xcchargen/start%xn.  You can access the chargen commands from anywhere on the game.

You can use %xccg/next%xn and %xccg/prev%xn to navigate through the stages of chargen.  To view the current stage instructions again, just type %xccg%xn.
