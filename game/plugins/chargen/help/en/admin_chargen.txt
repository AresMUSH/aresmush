Admins with appropriate permissions can approve and reject character applications.  These commands tie in with the character's approval job in the Jobs System.  Approving a character closes the job.  Rejecting a character puts it into a pending state until they re-submit.

    %xcapp <name>%xn - Reviews someone's application, showing any chargen errors or warnings.
    %xcapp/approve <name>%xn
    %xcapp/reject <name>=<message>%xn - Unlocks them so they can make changes.
