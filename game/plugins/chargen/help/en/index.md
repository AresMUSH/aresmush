# Character Creation

Character creation (aka chargen) here works a little differently than what you might be used to from other games.  

You can do chargen either on the [Web Portal](/help/website) or in-game.  They both have the same information - it's just a matter of preference.
 
To start chargen in the game, type `cg/start`.  You can access the chargen commands from anywhere on the game.  The chargen tutorial will prompt you step by step.

## Quick Reference - Common Commands

`chargen/start` - Starts chargen.
`cg/next` and `cg/prev` - Navigates the stages in chargen.
`cg` - View the current chargen page again.
