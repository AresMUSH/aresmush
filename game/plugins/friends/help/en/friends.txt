The Friends system helps you to interact with people you have designated as your friends.

    %xcfriends%xn - Shows your friends list.
    %xcfriend/add <name>%xn - Adds a friend.
    %xcfriend/remove <name>%xn - Removes a friend.
    %xcfriend/note <name>=<note>%xn - Adds a note to your friend.

You can use the friends list to control whose connect/disconnect messages you see.  See %xhhelp watch%xn.

You can have characters OR handles as friends.  When you add a handle as a friend, it is automatically shared across all the characters linked to your your handle.  If your friend's privacy settings allow it, you can see their alts on your friends list, which helps you find out if anyone else you know is playing on this game.
