Friends
====
The Friends plugin lets you add people as friends.  You can be notified when they log in.  Your friends list ties in with the Handles system's privacy features.

You can add characters on your current game as friends, but you can also add Handles as friends.  You can sync your list of Handle friends across all Ares games, so when you start playing on a new game you can see who else already plays there (if their privacy settings allow).
