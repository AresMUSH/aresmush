summary: Catching up on poses you missed.
---
The repose system keeps track of poses so you can catch up on what you've missed.  Pose order tracking is a tool to help you keep track of whose turn it is.  It is **not** intended to be a strict restriction on who's allowed to pose.  Use any order you like in a given scene.

`repose` - View catchup poses.
`repose/order` - Shows the pose order of the room.

You can disable the system temporarily to keep a scene private.

`repose/on` or `repose/off` - Turns the system on or off in a room.

Poses and pose order are automatically cleared every hour if there's nobody logged into the room.  If you start a new scene and there are remnants from an old one, you can clear the old poses and pose order.

`repose/clear`
