Pose
====

Posing is the term for communication that happens between characters who occupy the same MUSH room.  This is the 'meat' of the game, the descriptions of character speech and actions that make up the story. 

There are several commands for posing, some of which add your character's name and other text to the message automatically as a convenience.
