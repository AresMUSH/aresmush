# Who's Online

The `who` command shows you which other players are connected to the game and information about them.

`who` - Shows the who list.
`where` - Shows the who list including character locations.
`hide` and `unhide` - Controls whether your location shows up on the who list.
      There is no way in Ares to completely hide yourself from the who list or room
      descriptions (i.e. no dark/hidden power.)

## Searching the Who List

You can also search who and where for characters whose name starts with or matches a particular string.

`who <search>` or `where <search>`

## Who Is Someone?

The whois command lets you quickly look up a person's fullname and other info based on part of their full name, MU* character name, or callsign. 

`whois <name>`
