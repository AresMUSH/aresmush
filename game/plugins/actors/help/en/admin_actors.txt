Admin can set actors for other characters or NPCs.  When doing a NPC, you just specify their name the same as you would a PC - just make sure it doesn't conflict with any PC names.

    %xcactors/set <character>=<actor>%xn - Sets a character for a character or NPC.
    %xcactors/delete <character>%xn - Delete's an actor.
