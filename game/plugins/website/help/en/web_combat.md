# Managing Combats with the Web Portal

The Web Portal allows you to view combats in progress.  This can be a handy way to keep track of the combat status without having to type `combat` and spam your MUSH window over and over again.

> **Tip:** The combat display page doesn't auto-update, so you'll need to reload the page every time you want to get the current status.

## Setting Up Combats

Admins and combat organizers can also access a page where they can setup gear, stances, NPC levels and teams for all combatants quickly.

> **Tip:** The combat setup page is best used at the beginning of combat before players start entering their own commands.  Otherwise you risk of someone changing gear in the game and then having it overwritten from the web (or vice-versa).
