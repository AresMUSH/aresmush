# Creating a Character with the Web Portal

Once you have a character, you can perform the rest of [Character Creation](/help/chargen) on the web.  To get a character, you can create one from the [connect screen](/help/connect) or  [register](/help/website/web_login) on the web portal.

The web chargen is far easier than the in-game one.  All the stages are together on the same page, and there are visual cues and links to all the information you'll need.

## Viewing Points and Problems

The "App Status" tab will show you how many Ability Points you've spent, as well as any issues that may hold up your application.

## Setting Character Information

The other tabs allow you to set up the different bits of your character's information.  

> **Tip:** Changes to your character are not made in-game until you click the Save button or switch tabs.  Save early.  Save often.

## Submitting Your Character for Approval

When you're finished setting all your information, you can use the 'Submit' button at the bottom to submit your character for approval.  You'll need to log into the game to check the status of your app.
