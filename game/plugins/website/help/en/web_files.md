# Uploading Files to the Web Portal

Unlike some other wikis, which store files per-page, the Ares web portal has a central file repository.  This allows images to easily be used across multiple pages.

You can upload and view available files just by visiting the [File Repository](/files).  Click on any file to view or manage it.

> **Tip:** If you want to overwrite/replace an existing file, be sure the 'overwrite' checkbox is checked.

Once an image file is uploaded, you can use it on any page with:

`[[image filename.jpg]]`  

You can also use it in your character profile as explained in .  If you upload something that is not an image, you can link to it like so:

`[Link Text](/filename.jpg)`

See the <a href="/help/markdown">markdown reference</a> for more image formatting options.</p>
