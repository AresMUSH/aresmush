# Editing Your Character Profile on the Web

Once you're approved, you can edit your character's web portal profile.  To edit your profile, log in to the web portal and and click the 'Profile' link at the top.  Then go to the bottom of the page and click 'Edit'.

> **Tip:** You may only edit your own character's profile.  If you are using a player handle, you may also alts linked to your handle.

Basic information will be automatically filled in from the game - name, demographics, etc.  When your character has a birthday, your age will automatically update.

## Adding a Profile Image and Icon

See [Setting Your Web Portal Icon](/help/web_icon).

## Adding Profile Sections

You can set up your own custom profile sections.  Each section can contain [markdown  text](/help/website/markdown) with links and other formatting.  You can also edit your profile sections in the game (see [Profile](/help/profile)).

## Adding Relationships

The web portal will display your character's relationships.  Each relationship can contain a name, category and a description.  The description can contain [markdown  text](/help/website/markdown).  You can also edit relationships in the game (see [Relationships](/help/relationships)).  

## Adding Images to Your Gallery

Your character profile includes an image gallery.  All images must first be uploaded to the [File Repository](/files).  Once they're there, just add the filenames, one per line, to the gallery list.

## Applying Tags

Character profiles can contain tags, which allow them to be automatically included on certain [wiki pages](/help/website/wiki).  Tags should be a space-separated list of single words (which may contain special characters like - or :).

> **Tip:** If you mark pages with a special `player:<playername>` tag, the characters will show up as alts on the Players Directory page.  This is not necessary if the character is already registered to your player handle.  "Playername" can be your "main" character's name or any other player moniker you want to use.

## Viewing Page Source

If you see some neat formatting on someone's character profile and want to see how they did it, you can view the page source to see the raw markdown.
