# Playing from the Web Portal

The web portal provides a wealth of information and tools for interacting with the game, but if you want to actually _play_ the game you need to connect via telnet and use the old-fashioned MUSH commands.  

Fortunately, the web portal also provides a simple web client that lets you do this from your web browser.

The web client doesn't have any of the bells and whistles of Atlantis or Potato, but it's good in a pinch if you can't connect from your full client.

> **Tip:** Reloading or closing the web client browser page will close your connection to the game.
