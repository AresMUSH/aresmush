# Setting Your Web Portal Icon

Your **profile image** is the picture featured on your profile page.  

Various places on the website will use a mini version of your profile image, which is known as your **profile icon** (or sometimes "log icon").  

The web portal will try to scale down the profile image as best it can, but sometimes it just doesn't work very well.  If this happens to you, you can upload a dedicated profile icon for your character.

> **Tip:** Profile icons should ideally be square and around 300x300 pixels.

Both the profile image and icon can be set by editing your [Character Profile](/help/web_profile).  You'll first need to upload the file to the [Files Repository](/help/web_files).
