    # Special things that can be added to weapons, like special ammunition or
    # accessories.  These can modify any or all of the following weapon stats:
    #    - lethality, penetration, ammo, recoil, accuracy
    # The number is *added to* the weapon's base stat.  So an armor-piercing
    # mod with penetration: 3 would add 3 to the base penetration of the weapon.
