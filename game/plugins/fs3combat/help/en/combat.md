# FS3 Combat

The FS3 Combat system is designed to bring some order to the chaos of large combat scenes, managing ability rolls and tracking damage in an automated fashion. 

To learn how FS3 combat works, you should read the [FS3 Combat Player's Guide](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/combat) and try out the [Interacive Combat Walkthrough](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/combat-walkthrough).

There is also an online [Quick Reference](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/combat-quickref) to the most common combat commands.
