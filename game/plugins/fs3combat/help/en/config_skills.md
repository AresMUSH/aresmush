# Configuring FS3 Combat - Skills

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

To configure the FS3 Combat Skills:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.
2. Select 'FS3 Combat'.

The combat rules require you to determine which abilities are used for the following rolls:

- **Composure** (default = Composure) - Used for knockout rolls and stress resistance.
- **Recovery** (default = Athletics) - Used to determine if someone gets a bonus healing point during the daily healing roll.
- **Treat** (default = Medicine) - Used for the treat commands to provide immediate assistance to injuries.
- **Heal** (default = Medicine) - Used to determine how many patients a doctor can heal at once, and whether those people get a bonus healing point during the daily healing roll.
- **Initiative** (default = Alertness) - Used to determine who goes first in a combat turn.
- **Default Defense** (default = Reflexes) - Used for defense rolls outside of melee and vehicle combat.  Melee combat uses the defender's melee weapon skill, and vehicle combat uses their piloting skill.  You can override this for a specific combatant type.  See [Miscellaneous Combat Config](/help/fs3combat/config_misc).

> **Tip:** Make sure these are *skills*, not just attributes, otherwise people will roll terribly.
