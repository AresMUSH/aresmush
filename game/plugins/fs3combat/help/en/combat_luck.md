# FS3 Combat - Luck

Luck points (see [Luck](/help/luck)) have special effects in combat.

## Bonus Dice

Each turn, you can spend a luck point to get +3 bonus dice to either attack, defense or initiative.  You can only spend luck on one of them per turn, so make sure it's something relevant to what you're going to do that turn.

`combat/luck <attack, defense or initiative>` - Spend a luck point this turn. 

> **Tip:** Spending luck on attack affects special attacks like explosions or suppression.  It also conveys a bonus to damage.

## Avoiding Knockout

You can also spend luck to avoid a knockout.  This doesn't erase the damage, it just lets you soldier on in spite of it.

`combat/hero` - Spends a luck point to un-KO yourself.

> **Tip:** Before spending luck, remember that in some situations another play may be able to revive you with a rally or treat.  You might want to give them a chance first and save your luck for a more dire situation.
