Channels are public forums for out-of-character communication.  Each game will have a variety of channels available for use.  Some will be locked so that only people with certain roles may use them.

    %xcchannels%xn - Lists channels and their descriptions and roles.  Also shows at
        a glance which channels you're monitoring and the command to talk on them.

You will only see messages on channels you have chosen to join, and you may leave those channels at any time.  When you join a channel, you can specify an alias or nickname.  This becomes the command you use to talk on the channel.  If you don't specify anything, the alias defaults to a "+" and the first three characters of the channel name.  For example, the Public channel would be +pub, and to talk on it you would use %xh+pub Hi!%xn

    %xcchannel/join <channel>[=<alias>]%xn
    %xcchannel/leave <channel>%xn
    %xc<channelalias> <message>%xn - Talks on channel

NOTE: Take care to avoid channel aliases that overlap with other commands, like 'n' for north or 'p' for page.  Remember that AresMUSH ignores prefixes like '+' on commands to (so +p is out too).

You can also use MUX-style channel commands, by using the keywords "on", "off", "who", "gag", and "ungag" with the channel alias.  For example:  %xhpub who%xn.

Other handy channel commands:
    %xcchannel/who <channel>%xn - Shows who's on the channel
    %xcchannel/alias <channel>=<alias>%xn - Changes the alias used to talk on the channel.
    %xcchannel/title <channel>=<title>%xn - Sets a title displayed before your name.
        You can use ansi codes in this title.
    %xcchannel/gag <channel> or channel/ungag <channel>%xn - Despams for awhile.
        Gagging is cleared when you disconnect.
