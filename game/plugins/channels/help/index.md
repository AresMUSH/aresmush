# Channels

Channels are public forums for out-of-character communication.  Each game will have a variety of channels available for use.  Some will be locked so that only people with certain roles may use them.

## Quick Reference - Common Commands

`channels` - List channels and the commands to talk on them.
`channel/join <channel>[=<alias>]`
`channel/leave <channel>`
`<channelalias> <message>` - Talks on a channel.

> **Tip:** AresMUSH also supports the MUX-style channel commands, so you can use the keywords "on", "off", "who", "last", "mute", and "unmute" with the channel alias.  For example:  `pub who`.
