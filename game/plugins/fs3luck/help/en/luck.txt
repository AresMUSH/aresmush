Luck Points in FS3 can be used to generate various lucky breaks.  Luck points are earned through cookies (see %xhhelp cookies%xn).  You can view your available luck points on your character sheet.

You can use luck points for combat, ability rolls, or other plot points at the storyteller's discretion.

    %xcluck/spend <points>%xn - Spends luck outside of combat.
    See %xchelp combat luck%xn for combat-related luck commands.

For ability rolls, you can use a luck point in different ways.  These effects are not automated; you should spend the luck point and then apply the appropriate modifier (or re-roll) manually using the roll commands (%xhhelp roll%xn):

* Before your own roll, spend a point to receive a +5 modifier.

* Before someone else's roll, spend a point to apply a +5 or -5 modifier to their roll.

* After your own roll, spend a point to get a re-roll and choose the better of the two rolls.

* Spend a point to cancel a luck point used against you.

Note: Only one Luck Point can apply to a given roll, so you can't give yourself a bonus and someone else a penalty in the same Opposed Roll. Also, you can't have multiple people all spending luck to help someone.
