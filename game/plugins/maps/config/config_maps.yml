maps:
    # There is actually no configuration here for the maps system.  All you need to do is 
    # put files into the 'maps' directory.  The names should match your room area names, but
    # must be *ALL LOWERCASE*.  Multi-word names are fine.
    #
    # The map files themselves are plain text like the connect screen and can contain ascii art,
    # ansi codes, etc.
