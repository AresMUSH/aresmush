Demographics
====
The Demographics plugin works in conjunction with the Chargen plugin to provide a way to set basic character stats.

Some of the stats included in the out-of-the-box configuration are listed below, but it's pretty easy to add more with a minor code tweak.

* Age/Birthday
* Height, Weight
* Hair Color, Eye Color
* Full name
* and more!
