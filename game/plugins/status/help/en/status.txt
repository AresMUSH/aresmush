Your character status is a general reflection of what you're doing on the game.

    AFK (Away from the Keyboard)
    IC (In an In Character area, aka "Onstage")
    OOC (In an Out of Character area, aka "Offstage")
    NEW (A new character who has not been approved)
    ADM (Admin on duty)

IC/OOC status is determined by where you are.  Some rooms are IC areas; others are OOC.  See the following help files for more information about the various commands that affect your status:

* help afk (to go afk) 
* help onstage (to go ic/onstage)
* help offstage (to go ooc/offstage)
* help playerbit (to mark this char as a player bit)
