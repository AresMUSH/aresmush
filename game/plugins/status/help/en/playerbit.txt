Sometimes players like to make a character just for OOC purposes, to keep page and channel chatter away from their PCs.  These are called %xcPlayer Bits%xn.   Often a player bit's will mirror their handle name (help handles).  

If you have such a character, you can mark them as a player bit so the code knows that they're not a real IC character.
