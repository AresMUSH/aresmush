# Status

Your character status is a general reflection of what you're doing on the game.  It shows up on the who list and can affect other commands as well.

    AFK (Away from the Keyboard)
    IC (In an In Character area, aka "Onstage")
    OOC (In an Out of Character area, aka "Offstage")
    NEW (A new character who has not been approved)
    ADM (Admin on duty; off-duty admins show up as OOC)

IC/OOC status is determined by where you are.  Some rooms are IC areas; others are OOC.

Player Bits are special characters that are OOC only.

## Quick Reference - Common Commands

`onstage` - Go onstage.
`offstage` - Go offstage.
`afk [<reason>]` - Go AFK.
