Status
====
Your character status is a general reflection of what you're doing on the game.

IC/OOC status is determined by where you are, not some arbitrary setting.  Some rooms are IC areas; others are OOC.

The AFK command is used to mark yourself "away from the keyboard", in cases where you need to dash off to take care of something in real life.  

**In rooms:**

    Faraday  <AFK> Getting dinner.

**In pages:**

    %% (to Bob): Faraday says, "Hi."
    %% Bob is 3h idle and may be AFK.
