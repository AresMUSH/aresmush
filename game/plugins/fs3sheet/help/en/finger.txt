Folks looking for a "+finger" command like on other MUSHes will not find one here.  Instead there are distinct commands depending on what you're looking for:

The %xcinfo%xn command views someone's character sheet for IC information (name/age/etc.)

The %xcprofile%xn command views someone's OOC information (timezone, last connected, etc.)

You will also find that some information you may previously have needed to look up (name, rank, etc.) can be found in the character descriptions just by using the %xclook%xn command on them.

See the respective help files for these other commands for more information.
