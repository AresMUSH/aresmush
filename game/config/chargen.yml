  demographics_blurb: "Set the basic information about your character here."
  groups_blurb: "[Schools](/wiki/schools) reflect the type of spells a magic user is able to do. A magic user may have an affinity for a single School, or they may possess an affinity for two, one lesser and one greater. \n\nSetting your School(s) here will set your Major School to level 2 and your Minor School to level 1. If you choose only a Major School, you can raise it to level 3 on the Action Skills tab."
  bg_blurb: "You don't need to write a novel. Just cover the basics: who you are, why are you here, and is there anything noteworthy about you. Be sure to explain any unusual skills.\n\n
  * What are the major events in your character's life?
  * Where are they from, what do they do for a living?
  * Why have they come to Grand Lake? If they were drawn by the dreams, what might motivate them to stay? How will they make that work?\n
  *New characters cannot have been living within magic's influence before approval - though they can be local characters returning home.*\n\n
  **Magic and Coming to Grand Lake**\n
  Magic has been slowly trickling back into the world since early 2019.\n\n
  Although Grand Lake seems to have an abnormally high population of magic users, not all character will be natives. Those who are not are drawn to Grand Lake via dreams. Vague at first, the dreams grow increasingly explicit. They feature images of the Rocky Mountains and Grand Lake, along with an unmistakable sense that answers lie there. Later dreams may include an outright calling, a whisper that tells you to come join the others in Grand Lake. The dreams are largely hopeful, but some may sense an ominous undercurrent (before it's too late) in their dreams."
  desc_blurb: You can set both your main description, visible when people look at
    you, and a short description that shows your character at a glance.
  hooks_blurb: "RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can
    hook into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character
    has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you. Looking
    around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP
    Hooks.\n\nYour RP Hooks will also show in the welcome message posted to the forum, so everyone gets a snapshot of who your character is."
  hooks_required: true
  icon_blurb: "Upload an optional picture for your character icon. Square images work best."
  lastwill_blurb: "If you would like to register a preference on what happens if you ever idle out, you can fill out your lastwill here.  You could leave your character's fate up to someone else, or specify that they be killed off or sent away.\n\nYou can fill out or change your lastwill at any time on game using the `lastwill` command."
  post_approval_message: Please make sure they have a profile image for their log
    icon.
  rejection_message: "Sorry, your character could not be approved at the present time for the reasons listed.  You can make changes to your app by visiting [Create a Character](/chargen) on the web portal. \n\nFeel free to leave comments in this request or to ask for help on the **New Characters** channel if you have any questions."
