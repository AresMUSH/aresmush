  approval_message: Congratulations!  Your application has been approved.  Check out

  demographics_blurb: Set the basic information about your character here.
  groups_blurb: "[Schools](/wiki/schools) reflect the type of spells a magic user
    is able to do. A magic user may have an affinity for a single School, or they
    may possess an affinity for two, one lesser and one greater. \n\nSetting your
    School(s) here will set your Major School to level 2 and your Minor School to
    level 1. If you choose only a Major School, you can raise it to level 3 on the
    Action Skills tab.\n\nWe highly suggest that new players choose two Schools rather
    than one. In practice a lot of people find one magic school to be limiting in
    play. A character who has access to two schools, major and minor, will be a lot
    more versatile and possibly find hooks into plot more easily."
  bg_blurb: "You don't need to write a novel. Just cover the basics: who you are,
    why are you here, and is there anything noteworthy about you. \n\n   *New characters
    cannot have been living within magic's influence before approval - though they
    can be local characters returning home.*\n\n **Magic and Coming to Grand Lake**\n\n
    Magic has been slowly trickling back into the world since early 2019. \n\n Although
    Grand Lake seems to have an abnormally high population of magic users, not all
    characters will have a previous connection to Grand Lake. Many, including those
    who grew up in the area, are drawn to Grand Lake via dreams, which began in December
    2018. Vague at first, the dreams grow increasingly explicit about the location.
    They feature images of the Rocky Mountains and Grand Lake, along with an unmistakable
    sense that answers lie there. They don't reveal further details - only that Grand
    Lake is the place to come, with a hint that there might be answers - and others
    experiencing the same thing - there. \n\n **Some questions to consider in your
    background:**\n\n * Where is your character from?\n * What are the major events
    in your character's life? \n * What is their education, and what do they do for
    a living?\n * Why have they come to Grand Lake? What spurred the move NOW, after
    more than a year of dreams?\n * What might motivate them to stay in Grand Lake?
    How will they make that work?\n * Do they have any unusual skills you want to
    provide context for? "
  desc_blurb: You can set both your main description, visible when people look at
    you, and a short description that shows your character at a glance.
  hooks_blurb: |-
    RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can hook into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you. Looking around at other  [character's profile pages](/characters) can be a good way to get inspiration for RP Hooks.

    Your RP Hooks will also show in the welcome message posted to the forum, so everyone gets a snapshot of who your character is.

  icon_blurb: Upload an optional picture for your character icon. Square images work
    best.

    The online character creation tool will guide you through creating your character. We recommend reading our [guidelines & help](/wiki/guides:join_us) before getting started. You should also read the [World Intro](/wiki/guides:world_intro) for a fast and dirty introduction to theme.

      You can also open the [Character Creation Guide](/wiki/guides:character_creation) in a new tab.
  lastwill_blurb: |-
    If you would like to register a preference on what happens if you ever idle out, you can fill out your lastwill here.  You could leave your character's fate up to someone else, or specify that they be killed off or sent away.

    You can fill out or change your lastwill at any time on game using the `lastwill` command.
  lorehook_blurb: |-
    Lore Hooks are bits of fun lore that are unique to you. See (help Lore Hooks)[/help/lore_hooks] and the [Guide to Lore Hooks](https://tinyurl.com/y6zgez98) for more info on each type of hook.

    Storytellers begin working on Lore Hooks once a character has been played for at least two months.

    If you have preferences for the sort of Lore Hook you recieve, please add them to your plot preferences on your character page after approval. Generally, STs will create something that we think will be interesting for your character and that fits into the story, but we'll keep preferences in mind where possible. You can also set or change your preference any time after CG, and add specific preferences in your [plot preferences](/help/plotprefs).

      title: Chargen Commands
      text: You can do chargen either on the web portal (help web portal) or in-game.  They
        both have the same information - it's just a matter of preference.%R%RIf you
        choose to use the in-game chargen, the %xccg%xn command will walk you through
        the necessary steps.%R%RYou can go back and forth through the steps of chargen
        as much as you want using %xccg/next%xn and %xccg/prev%xn.
    app:
      title: App Review
      text: The `app` command is your friend during chargen.  It will alert you to
        things you may have forgotten to set.  %xrred%xn issues will almost certainly
        prevent your character from being approved (like forgetting to set your eye
        color).  %xyYellow%xn issues are warnings; they might actually be OK if it
        fits the character concept.
