  bg_blurb: "A background is your character's backstory or history.  Please keep backgrounds to
    4,000 characters (about 700 words) for readability.<br><br>Some questions to consider in your background
    <ul><li>Where is your character from?</li>
      <li>What are the major events in your character's life?</li>
      <li>What was your mythic's life before they bonded? How do your character and your mythic feel about their bond?</li>
      <li>Why did they choose to become a Warden? If they have been a Warden for some time, what sorts of things have they done?</li>
      <li>Do they have any unusual skills you want to provide context for?</li></ul>"
  demographics_blurb: Demographics record your basic character info.
  desc_blurb: You can set both your main description, visible when people look at
    you, and a short description that shows your character at a glance.
  groups_blurb: Groups determine your character's affiliations.
  hooks_blurb: "RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can
      hook into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character
      has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you. Looking
      around at other characters can be a good way to get inspiration for RP
      Hooks.<br><br>Your RP Hooks will also show in the welcome message posted to the forum, so everyone gets a snapshot of who your character is. It's nice to do these in a bullet-pointed list to make them easy to read."
  hooks_required: true
  icon_blurb: "Your profile icon appears in scenes and the character gallery to show
      your character at a glance. Providing a profile icon is optional. You can upload
      additional character images once you're approved.<br><br>All images should be publicly available
      and feature public persons such as actors, models, or professional athletes."
  lastwill_blurb: Idled out characters will generally be presumed to be on a duty rotation at a Warden Outpost, so that they can be picked back up if you wish to return. If you have a different preference, you can register it with your character's 'last will'.
  post_approval_message: Please make sure they have a profile image for their log
    icon.
  rank_blurb: Military rank.
  rejection_message: Sorry, your character could not be approved at the present time
    for the reasons described below.  Please see %xhhelp app%xn for help making changes
    and resubmitting, and contact the person handling your application if you have
    any questions.

      title: App Review
      text: The `app` command is your friend during chargen.  It will alert you to
        things you may have forgotten to set.  %xrred%xn issues will almost certainly
        prevent your character from being approved (like forgetting to set your eye
        color).  %xyYellow%xn issues are warnings; they might actually be OK if it
        fits the character concept.

      text: You've completed chargen!  Review your app one more time, and use `app/submit
        [<optional notes>]` to submit your character when ready.  The admins will
        make sure it's a good fit for the game's theme, that the skills are reasonable
        given the background, and that you haven't missed anything important in chargen.
