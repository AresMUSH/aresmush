    why are you here, and is there anything noteworthy about you. Be sure to explain
    any unusual skills.'
  hooks_blurb: RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can
    hook into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character
    has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you. Looking
    around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP
    Hooks.
