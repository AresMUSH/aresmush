  description: 'Set in the tiny Colorado town of Grand Lake, Spirit Lake is a game  that
    explores what happens when magic re-enters the world. Grand Lake has long  been
    known as the gateway to the Rockies. It turns out that it''s also a gateway to
    other worlds.  Portals have begun to open nearby, letting humans cross into other
    worlds - and letting things from those worlds cross into ours. At the same time,
    some have found themselves gifted with inexplicable powers that they don''t understand
    and don''t know how to control. Abruptly, the world is magical again.
