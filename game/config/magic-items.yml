    desc: The eye is a perfect orb, larger than the size of a closed fist, composed of a freckled gold stone. It is preserved in an eternally seeing state with its diamond shaped pupil large and black as night. To look upon it for too long is unnerving as if the great snake still watches one's movements. It is cool to the touch. Allows the possessor to cast %xBDreamtrap%xn on a target.

  Band Of The Unseen:
    name: Band of the Unseen
    desc: A slender golden armband, the magical item is embossed with a depiction of the antagonist god Set. He is represented traditionally here. The only variation is the brightly colored blindfold that's been tied over his eyes. When worn in the open or beneath one's clothes, the armband acts as a blockade against intrusions from the Spirit school by those who would do the wearer ill. Magic users with friendly or sincerely good intentions are not protected against.
