  - name: Welcome Basket What Potion
    text: Sure, let me know what 'for fun' potion you'd like from the list in the [welcome basket page](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/welcome_basket).
  - name: Welcome Basket Recieved
    text: "Potions added! Type `potions` to see them in your potion inventory, and see `help potions`\n\nYou are now in possession of a [Welcome Basket](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/welcome_basket). The small gift basket has been artfully arranged and filled with a small variety of local goods such as hand cream and lip balm. Several potions are tucked in as well, including a Medium Heal potion, a Telekinetic Armor potion, and one labeled 'Just for Fun!' It also holds reading material filled with important information about getting involved in the Weird:\n\n
      * A welcome pamphlet from the Council containing the [magical charter](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/weird_docs:charter) by which all mages must abide.\n
      * A spiral-bound printed edition of the most current [Guide to the Weird](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/weird_docs:a_guide_to_the_weird_2nd_ed), as well as the [Magical Primer](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/weird_docs:magic_primer_and_spellbook).\n\nBe sure to check out the reading, as it will offer a lot of helpful information, which you now have ICly."
  - name: Level 1 spells
    text: "Your level 1 spells have been added! You can ICly cast these whenever you like. \n\nLevel 1 spells often happen spontaneously with brand new baby spellcasters, and they generally will happen in times of extreme focus of some sort. Trying to recreate a spell you accidentally cast is just as (nay, more!) random as innate magic, with more serious consequences. So it's possible to 'oops' into a spell, but you're going to have to start to do some work to cast it reliably.\n\nOnly level 1 spells tend to be accidents - higher level, more complicated spells are intentionally learned or developed things. You can begin to learn level 2 spells and onward using spell/learn as soon as you you have XP to do so (even if, ICly, you don't know how to learn spells yet - just don't cast them until you do!)."
  - name: Scholar Token
    text: "The Bibliothēkē is grand, an immense, enormous thing filled with more knowledge than any one person could ever consume in even a very, very long lifetime. On entering the [Bibliothēkē Foyer](https://spiritlakemu.com/location/5080), you are met by a librarian. Easily seven feet tall,his skin is a pale grey, mottled and pebbly. A pair of leathery, reptilian wings are kept folded neatly against his back, poking just above his head and stretching down to brush the ground beneath his clawed feet. His face features a snout, reptile-like, along with wide-set eyes of deep black.\n\nAfter casting Comprehend Languages, he introduces himself as Khadum, and impassively helps you through the process of offering their knowledge and presenting their trypa. Once completed, you are given a bronze-colored disk with words in Soitos circling it: //one good, knowledge, one evil, ignorance//. Your Scholar's Token."
  - name: Free Minor Heal
    text: "In the WeirdDocs, one can find instruction on how to obtain teaching via Spirit magic of certain minor spells from some of the portal creatures. A select few keepers of Lualea are skilled enough to teach Minor Heal in this manner. When you seeks them out, you're led to a young human-like man who calls himself Geovis, who offers to impart this. Via the spell Rewrite History, he gives to you not only the forms he uses in casting and memories of the outcome of the spell, but also the instinctive imprint of how he casts it. And, when he's done, you can mimic it perfectly."
  - name: Free Minor Telekinesis
    text: "Among the WeirdDocs is information that, in certain portals, one can find creatures gifted in Spirit magic who can teach certain specific spells directly to someone's mind. If one is willing to let them rearrange a few brain cells. It's easy enough to find one's way to Stochieion and find one of the creatures there who typically does so.\n\nA fire salamander who calls himself Ignis offers his services. A gregarious, exciteable creature, he's very interested in conversation, about yourself, about humanity, and most especially about Will magic. It fascinates him, for, when the portals are closed, Will is entirely foreign to Stochieion. Ancient mages, long ago, used it to aid the creatures here in stabilizing their world from the powerful elemental storms that ravaged it, but it is not a gift native to the portal. Magic is a raw force in Stochieion but, somehow, Will balances it, and human mages have always been integral to that.\n\n Some of their memories are stored among the keepers of such holy things, and in this way, they are passed on to those humans who request them.\n\nAfter a cast, Ignis' spell works upon the mind and...it is not exactly a memory you're given. You really see or understand where it came from, save a brief glimpse of human hands working the forms of magic. But something primal is implanted in your brain, in those places that store the doing of things, like riding a bicycle or sewing. Things learned so deeply they can be done by instinct.\n\nAnd, after that spell, the instinct of how to cast Minor Telekinesis lives in your mind.\n\nYou can now cast Minor Telekinesis."

  - name: Library Research
    text: "The Bibliothēkē is grand, an immense, enormous thing filled with more knowledge than any one person could ever consume in even a very, very long lifetime. On arrival, you are met in the [foyer](https://spiritlakemu.com/location/5080) by a librarian, Khadum. Easily seven feet tall, his skin is a pale grey, mottled and pebbly.

He leaves you in the [reading room](https://spiritlakemu.com/location/5081) as he disappears into the closed stacks to retrieve volumes which may contain the appropriate information."
