  - name: Welcome Basket What Potion
    text: Sure, let me know what 'for fun' potion you'd like from the list in the [welcome basket page](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/welcome_basket).
  - name: Welcome Basket Recieved
    text: "Potions added! Type `potions` to see them in your potion inventory, and see `help potions`\n\nYou are now in possession of a [Welcome Basket](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/welcome_basket). The small gift basket has been artfully arranged and filled with a small variety of local goods such as hand cream and lip balm. Several potions are tucked in as well, including a Medium Heal potion, a Telekinetic Armor potion, and one labeled 'Just for Fun!' It also holds reading material filled with important information about getting involved in the Weird:\n\n
      * A welcome pamphlet from the Council containing the [magical charter](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/weird_docs:charter) by which all mages must abide.\n
      * A spiral-bound printed edition of the most current [Guide to the Weird](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/weird_docs:a_guide_to_the_weird_2nd_ed), as well as the [Magical Primer](https://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/weird_docs:magic_primer_and_spellbook).\n\nBe sure to check out the reading, as it will offer a lot of helpful information, which you now have ICly."
  - name: Level 1 spells
    text: "Your level 1 spells have been added! You can ICly cast these whenever you like. \n\nLevel 1 spells often happen spontaneously with brand new baby spellcasters, and they generally will happen in times of extreme focus of some sort. Trying to recreate a spell you accidentally cast is just as (nay, more!) random as innate magic, with more serious consequences. So it's possible to 'oops' into a spell, but you're going to have to start to do some work to cast it reliably.\n\nOnly level 1 spells tend to be accidents - higher level, more complicated spells are intentionally learned or developed things. You can begin to learn level 2 spells and onward using spell/learn as soon as you you have XP to do so (even if, ICly, you don't know how to learn spells yet - just don't cast them until you do!)."
