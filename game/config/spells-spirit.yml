    desc: "The caster is capable of concealing a fragment of their spirit and binding it to an inanimate object. If the caster is killed, their full spirit enters the object after 60 seconds.\n\nUsing this spell does not harm the caster. Though it may contain a portion of the caster's spirit, they have no awareness of the object once leaving its presence. \n\nThe object may be stored anywhere, but there must be an open portal path between the caster and the object within 60 seconds of death in order for the spirit to enter the object. Otherwise, they are killed.\n\nOnce their full spirit has entered the object, the caster exists as a sapient object. They are incapable of movement but retain their spell casting abilities. Any who hold the trinket can freely converse with the caster via telepathy.\n\nIf the object is destroyed, so is that piece of the caster\u2019s spirit. If the object is destroyed after the caster fully inhabits it, the caster dies permanently."
