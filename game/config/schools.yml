schools:
  Air:
    name: Air
    id: 1
    blurb: "Magic focused on air, wind, and lightning, its practitioners reign supreme and soar high above their peers.  Don’t let the name fool you, casters of Air magic can manipulate any sort of gaseous substance - air is simply the most plentiful and far-reaching.  They can also shift and shape the movement of charged particles in the atmosphere around them, resulting in bursts of electricity. \n\nAn amateur Air spellcaster may have been a grizzled aeronautical expert or RC hobbyist driven by a passion for flight. A more pragmatic mind may pursue mastery of this school due to its inherent versatility.  \n\nAt the earliest levels, Air mages learn to create gusts of varying strengths and intensities. As their power increases, they may learn to manipulate oxygen, noxious smog, or take to the sky in awe-inspiring flight.    \n\nAir mages have a special affinity for their element. Without casting a spell, they can sense the currents of the air within a dozen yards. They are sensitive to changes in air pressure at the same range. The wind often caresses them, stirring their hair or clothes with a gentle breeze that might shift with their moods. These innate abilities are wildly unreliable in the novice user, though experienced users generally learn to control them."
  Corpus:
    name: Corpus
    id: 2
    blurb: "Magic focused on the body of sapient creatures, casters in this school wield life and decay.\n\n A staple of any successful adventuring party, healers are often unfairly typecast as pacifists. Corpus mages learn very early on in their experimentations with magic that what life gives, life can and will take away. Sure, Corpus spellcasters include quite a few selfless would-be medical students or the occasional religious fanatic, but the path is just as likely to draw from the vampire-obsessed goth subculture. Necromancer?! I hardly know her!\n\n At their lowest levels, Corpus casters learn to heal or deal raw damage. As their power grows, they learn to reshape the human body to resemble someone else’s, bring someone back from the brink of death, or kill with a single touch.\n\n Corpus users have an affinity for the sapient body. Without casting a spell, they often sense the presence of someone within a dozen feet of them, and they may tell at a glance when something is 'off' with someone's health. They are oddly resistant to minor viruses and infections and are hardly ever seen with a cold, especially as they gain in strength. These innate abilities are wildly unreliable in the novice user, though experienced users generally learn to control them."
  Earth:
    name: Earth
    id: 3
    blurb: "Magic focused on earth, rock, and metal, casters hold dominion over the very foundation upon which we live our lives.\n\n The fledgling spellcaster of the Earth school may have been an expert spelunker or burgeoning geologist, inexplicably drawn to try and understand the earth and its many secrets. Or maybe they were just a snot-nosed brat who liked hucking rocks at passing cars, got a spark of the old magic razzle-dazzle, and decided to up their window-breaking game. We’re not judging. (We totally are.) Be they a wild, bucking earthquake or grounded and methodical, an Earth mage leaves no stone left unturned!\n\n At the earliest levels, Earth mages curve outcroppings of earth to shield themselves from danger or create seismic vibrations beneath the feet of their enemies. As they increase in ability, they gain the capacity to bend even the hardest metal structures and draw in minerals from the air around them to create entirely new constructs all their own.\n\n Earth mages have a special affinity for their element. Without casting a spell, they can often sense the basic properties of earth and rocks, finding sure footing in a swampy bog or choosing the best handholds on a cliff face. They tend toward an unerring sense of direction, and can point toward true North. They may find their movements accompanied by a cloud of dust that rises at their heels, clinging close to their company. These innate abilities are wildly unreliable in the novice user, though experienced users generally learn to control them."
  Fire:
    name: Fire
    id: 4
    blurb: "Magic focused on fire, heat, and light, members of this school wield a force as beautiful as it is destructive.\n\n Greek mythology says Prometheus stole fire from the Gods and bequeathed it to humanity. Some have theorized the first fire was sparked by such an immortal, that he taught us magic and how to use heat to make food and create new tools. (A lot) of others say that’s hogwash and that a fire mage interested in its more practical, less explosive applications is a golden goose.\n\n At its lowest levels, Fire mages learn to create light, energy and warmth. As their power grows, they learn to wield fiery explosions or delicate illusions born of light.\n\n Fire mages have a special affinity for their element. Without casting a spell, they often experience a minor immunity to heat up to 450F for a minute or so. Conversely, they often find themselves feeling the cold more acutely. Their body temperature may run hot, and flames may yearn toward them or flare suddenly with their moods. Similarly, light may brighten or dim to reflect their emotions. These innate abilities are wildly unreliable in the novice user, though experienced users generally learn to control them."
  Nature:
    name: Nature
    id: 5
    blurb: "Magic focused on plants and animals, its pupils return to the simplest and purest versions of themselves.\n\n Forests, tundras, jungles, and the ocean depths are home to immeasurable beauty and ferocity. Any practitioner of the Nature path must strive to encompass this dichotomy in order to establish a greater union with the natural world. For the Nature mage, magic is more complex than simply bending the world to one’s desires. The feral lifeforms manipulated by this school of witchcraft demand much finesse and respect.\n\n At its lowest levels, Nature mages learn to ally their hearts and minds with the flora and fauna in their area. At higher levels, they learn to adopt beastial forms and what it means to walk that fine line between the civilized world and the wild.\n\n Nature mages have an affinity for non-sapient creatures and plant life. Without casting a spell, they can often sense the presence of non-sapient creatures within a dozen feet of themselves, and creatures are usually unbothered by their presence. They tend to know at a glance when something is 'off' with a creature's health and have an innate understanding of the needs of plants. Their gardens and greenhouses experience surges of great bounty, flourishing with little effort, and houseplants may bend their leaves toward a favorite chair in an effort to be closer. These innate abilities are wildly unreliable in the novice user, though experienced users generally learn to control them."
  Spirit:
    name: Spirit
    id: 6
    blurb: "Magic focused on the sapient mind, [emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrasting_and_categorization_of_emotions#Parrott%27s_emotions_by_groups), and spirit, practitioners of this School are bid to focus inward, where true power lies.\n\n While the Miss Cleos of the world may have cheapened the artform, the ideals of Spirit magic are ancient and span across cultures, continents, and civilization. At its lowest levels, Spirit mages learn to exhibit variations on psychometry, aura reading, and the manipulation of good or bad luck. At higher levels, they learn to dictate thoughts, feelings, and actions to independent minds and to commune with the spirit world. \n\n Spirit mages have an innate sense of those sapient minds around them.\n\n Without casting a spell, they often sense the presence of someone within a dozen feet of them. They can generally tell when someone's [emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrasting_and_categorization_of_emotions#Parrott%27s_emotions_by_groups) run high, though it requires a spell to read the exact emotion. They may experience a sudden spike in adrenaline when a loved one is in danger without knowing why or how or who. \n\n These innate abilities are wildly unreliable in the novice user, though experienced users generally learn to control them."
  Water:
    name: Water
    id: 7
    blurb: "Magic focused on water and ice, those specializing in this school gain access to a power source of oceanic proportions.\n\n Nearly three quarters of the Earth’s surface is covered in water, much of which remains unexplored to this day. Over half of the human body is comprised of water. It bends to lunar cycles and, in human prose, represents everything from knowledge to the fluidity of our emotions. Its uses range from recreational to therapeutic and yet, it can be attributed to some of our most common and debilitating phobias.\n\n The Water adept sways with the ebb and flow of his, her or their current situation, conforming to environmental restrictions or slipping through the cracks in search of more hospitable conditions. Despite this adaptability, those who wield Water can exert considerable power. Have you ever witnessed the devastation left behind in a tsunami’s wake? Have you ever experienced a prolonged drought?\n\n At its lowest levels, Water mages breathe and tread water or manipulate frost and ice via touch. At higher levels, they learn to reconfigure and weaponize one of the fundamental elements of our very existence.\n\n Water mages have a special affinity for their element. Without casting a spell, they often experience a minor immunity to cold, down to -40F for a minute or so. Their body temperature often runs cold, and they may find that their breath fogs at odd times or condensation gathers under their touch. Conversely, they often find themselves feeling the heat more acutely. Running water sometimes dances joyfully in their presence, sending tiny droplets splashing toward them. Water mages can sense the currents of water within a dozen yards of themselves. These innate abilities are wildly unreliable in the novice user, though experienced users generally learn to control them."
  Will:
    name: Will
    id: 8
    blurb: "Magic focused on the physical world, students of this school come closest to altering reality itself.\n\n\"Do not try and bend the spoon, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth… there is no spoon. Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.\" - The Matrix, 1999\n\n Followers of this path learn to go against the grain and impose their will on a physical world that is ill-equipped to resist. \n\nAt their lowest levels, these practitioners manipulate objects physically through telekinesis and transmutation. As their power grows… Intangibility? Molecular disintegration? Their limitations may very well consist entirely of the ones they impose upon themselves.\n\n Will mages have an affinity for the physical world around them. Without casting a spell, they often sense the movement of non-organic objects within a dozen feet of themselves. They may find small objects, such as pens or keys, move a few feet to help out when they reach for them. Objects they own and use frequently tend to stay in good repair, resisting minor leaks and frays. These innate abilities are wildly unreliable in the novice user, though experienced users generally learn to control them."
