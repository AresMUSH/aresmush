    Aether:
      name: Aether
      id: 1
      blurb: "Aether magic deals in the energy of nature, calling it forth and manipulating it in order to produce devastating and awe-inspiring effects.\n\nMythics of the aether wield the power of air, fire, lightning, and other natural forces. They can bend light to create illusions, call a fireball down on their enemy, or imbue a weapon with the force of lightning.\n\nMagic with illusory effects is not always entirely unnoticeable. When cast on someone who possesses the appropriate enhanced senses, the target may notice that the spell has been cast.\n\nThey may attempt to do so with a roll of the caster's Aether vs the target's Alertness-4.  GMs may also choose to allow rolls for those with psionic abilities when appropriate. A draw goes to the caster.  A success does not prevent the spell's effects or identify the caster in any way."
    Arcane:
      name: Arcane
      id: 2
      blurb: "Arcane magic deals in the energy of the mind, emotions, and magic of living beings. It can manipulate and change these things, both to enhance and to diminish.\n\nMages of the arcane can soothe emotions, calm animals, delve into memories, boost and diminish magical abilities, and trick the mind. \n\nMagic with psionic effects is not always entirely unnoticeable. When cast on someone who also possesses Arcane magic or controlled telepathy, the target may notice that the spell has been cast.\n\nThose with Arcane magic may attempt to do so with a roll of the caster's Arcane vs the target's Arcane-4.  Bonded mages may attempt to do so with a roll of the caster's Arcane vs the target's Arcane-5.A draw goes to the caster.

    Creation:
      name: Creation
      id: 3
      blurb: "Creation magic impacts the physical things of nature by creating, healing, and urging the growth of new life. It can enhance what already exists, urging it toward a perfect version of itself. It can build and craft them into new shapes and possibilities.\n\nMages of creation can heal the hurting, imbue a fighter with renewed strength, coax flowers into bloom, purify tainted water, and mold the earth into new shapes.\n\nSome spells are unsuited for use during flight. Spells which rely on the manipulation of earth, rocks, and plants require the natural presence of those things. Other spells have static effects such as walls which do not move with the target."
    Entropy:
      name: Entropy
      id: 4
      blurb: "Entropy magic affects the physical things of nature by destroying, damaging, and urging the decay of what is alive.

It can destroy and decay, breaking apart natural constructs.\n\nMythics of entropy can rend the earth, sap the strength from an enemy, inflict damage on living bodies, and wield the power of cold to create ice.\n\nSome spells are unsuited for use during flight. Spells which rely on the manipulation of earth, rocks, and plants require the natural presence of those things. Other spells have static effects such as walls which do not move with the target."
