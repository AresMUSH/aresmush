Their brain and a handful of organs—heart, lungs, possibly some part of the digestive system, not much else—are atached to a synthesis of bionic parts and cybernetic systems. The whole thing is encased in a metallic form capable of wrestling giant robots and dragons to the ground while withstanding direct missile impacts.
