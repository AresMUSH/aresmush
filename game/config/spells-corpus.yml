Vocal mimicry is also imprecise, as the altered voice can be shifted to the chosen person's range, but cannot mimic their exact tone, speech patterns, or vocal tics.\n\nThe caster's shifted appearance is good enough to fool casual observers, but may be identified as false with a roll of the caster's Corpus vs the observer's Alertness-5. Those with significant knowledge of of the mimicked individual or enhanced senses such as smell or hearing are more likely to identify the caster as an impostor, and GMs may choose to adjust the modification as appropriate.

    desc: "The caster is able to fully heal damage to the body caused by injury or disease suffered within the past 10 years. With the appropriate medical knowledge (anatomy, biology, medicine, paramedics, surgery, etc) the caster can regrow a lost limb, restore function to a severed spine, repair deep scarring, mend old breaks, or heal other kinds of damage. The spell cannot cure any diseases, only the damage caused by them.\n\nDuring the casting process, both the target and the caster experience the memory of traumatic pain from the damage caused to the body. Phantom echoes of this pain will recur at random moments throughout the life of both the target and caster. Afterwards, a wound (about half as severe healed damage) is left on the caster which cannot be magically healed and the target loses 1 point in Brawn, representing the strain to their body from the healing and the rehabilitation they will need to do.\n\nOOC: Please notify Storytellers before using this spell, so they can make sure the damage in question can be healed, the caster has the required medical knowledge, and the wound and mechanical adjustments can be made."

    casting_time: 1 hour
    desc: "The caster sacrifices a sapient creature, siphoning the life force from it as they die in order to increase either the caster's own power or another sapient target's power. The sacrificed individual must be drained of blood to the point of permanent death of both the body and spirit.\n\nEach non-magical life sacrificed gives the target 5 Luck Points worth of power for the duration of the spell. Each magical life sacrificed gives the target 10 Luck Points worth of power. The power may be used for anything Luck Points may be spent on. For example, increasing attack, initiative, defense, or spellcasting; re-rolling a skill; reviving in combat; escaping without pursuit; learning spells at an advanced rate; creating spells at an advanced rate.\n\nThe magical schools of the sacrificed creature should be the same as the target's. Deviations from this result gaining the innate abilities of the magical schools of the target for the duration of the spell, but there will also be unpredictable and problematic consequences.\n\nNOTE: This spell may not be learned or used by PCs. Learning Sacrifice of Blood will be considered PvP and is only feasible if your PC will be shifted to an NPC as part of an approved plot."
