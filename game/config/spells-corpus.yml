Vocal mimicry is also imprecise, as the altered voice can be shifted to the chosen person's range, but cannot mimic their exact tone, speech patterns, or vocal tics.\n\nThe caster's shifted appearance is good enough to fool casual observers, but may be identified as false with a roll of the caster's Corpus vs the observer's Alertness-5. Those with significant knowledge of of the mimicked individual or enhanced senses such as smell or hearing are more likely to identify the caster as an impostor, and GMs may choose to adjust the modification as appropriate.
