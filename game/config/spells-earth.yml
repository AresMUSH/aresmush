Metal returns to its natural, but not necessarily original, state when the spell ends.\n\nEntire objects can be sculpted using Alter Metal, but making a functional object requires knowledge of how the object is made and works. The caster cannot make a functional knife, lock, clock, etc. without the knowledge of how they mechanically and structurally work—which may require steps beyond the spell to make the object function correctly.\n\nThe caster can manipulate small pieces of metal, no smaller 1 mm, with great precision. Manipulation of metal to use a pre-existing object requires knowledge. For example, the caster cannot use Alter Metal to move tumblers to open a lock without lockpicking knowledge.\n\nIn combat, damaging a weapon enough to disable it takes 3-5 rounds, at the GM's discretion."
