# Configuring the Database

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.


Your database was set up initially during the game installation.  If for some reason your database server changes, or you need to reset the password, you'll need to update the configuration.

To configure the database:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Advanced Config'.
3. Select `database.yml` to edit the database URL -or- select `secrets.yml` to edit the password.
4. Shut down and restart the game.  (See the tutorials at [aresmush.com](http://www.aresmush.com) if you need help doing this.)

> **Important!** Database configuration changes will not take effect until the game is restarted.
