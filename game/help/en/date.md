# Configuring the Date and Time Formats

> **Permission Required:** Configuring the game requires the Admin role.

The game shows dates and times in various places.  You can configure how these are shown. 

To configure the date and time preferencse:

1. Go to the Web Portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Date/Time Formats'.
 
## Types of Formats

The game supports several different types of formats, each of which may be configured:

* Short Date Format - This is used when you just want a short date, like 1/2/2016.  
* Long Date Format - This combines date and time into a longer format, like 27 March 2016, 5:45pm.
* Time Format - This is just the time by itself, like 5:45pm.
* Date Entry Format - see below

The 'date entry format help' configuration item is a little special.  It is not a code-oriented format string.  Rather, it is intended to be read by humans to tell them what format to enter birthdays and other dates.

## Formatting Options

You have complete control over each format.  You can change the it use hyphens, put the month first or second, use two-digit years instead of four-digit years, use 12 or 24-hour time, etc.  

> **Tip:** For full details of the available options, see the [Ruby Date/Time Format Documentation](https://apidock.com/ruby/DateTime/strftime).
