SUMMARY:In Honor Of Angus
DESCRIPTION:Teagan is holding a funeral for a cow, to respect his life. The news of this is probably sure to get around quickly, especially since she's not going to be especially shameful about telling anyone and everyone she knows. No formal invitation this time, and it's alternatively at Sage & Thyme Ranch or Andrade Ranch, depending if you are local or a newcomer.
