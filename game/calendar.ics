SUMMARY:Name A Ranch Party
DESCRIPTION:Heavy cream invitations, custom-made from a shop in Denver complete with handmade lace and a lacquered sprig of thyme, go out to all of the locals inviting them to a 'Ranch Naming Party' hosted by a 'Teagan Roberts Spencer' and 'Sebastian Miguel Andrade'. The address given is the old Andrade ranch. They do not ask for an RSVP. And I quote: 'Come as you are, go as you please. The world is free! #freedomofmovement #followingyourownmusic #teathymeranchparty'

SUMMARY:Wolfsbane Festival
DESCRIPTION:Townsfolk gather with warm drink, music, and merriment along with resident canines, who are released to play and run free a snow-encapsulated space. 
  
  Donated prizes, usually doggy merch from local crafters, are given out for accurately guessing the number of dogs present. ...unless you cheat and then everybody remembers that forever.
  
  OOC: Don't stress if you can't make it or find large scenes too daunting to attend. If it becomes too large, I'll likely split things off into two separate scenes so prepare for that. Clutch your pearls or whatever you've got to do!
