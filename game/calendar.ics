SUMMARY:Weird Town Hall
DESCRIPTION:It's not really a town hall. There's no politician, and no authority.
  
  But it's probably time for another meeting of people who know what might be coming, and want to be more prepared to deal with it. Details about agenda items to come, so people can show up prepared.
