SUMMARY:Hoarders
DESCRIPTION:Myths like to claim that dragons are fond of collecting things of value. Several of the young mages in Grand Lake will learn that though many myths have a grain of truth to them, 'things of value' is an awfully nebulous term...
  
  (This event will touch off a PRP storyline; I'd like to keep the participants to five or less for the sake of my sanity and speed of scene, so please do sign up.)

SUMMARY:Yaoguai Bounty
DESCRIPTION:Across the Western Market of Feixuzhicheng are numerous postings and wanted ads. One of them, more prominent than the others, asks for help in dealing with a demon who has attacked several farmers. The promised reward is great. Who will answer the wanted board?

SUMMARY:Runestone Moving Services
DESCRIPTION:A team of mages has been assembled to move the runestone from the battlefield next to the wolf portal to Khepri and Chionet's tomb. So far, Jonathan, Manny, DeLuz, Fenris, and Dani are all planning to help out. 
  
  This will be an open RP event for those who want to help or just want to come for the fun of it. Please feel free to join us, even if it's just to stand on the ground and provide commentary! (Though, if you see us from the ground, we've probably failed at least one part of it, so oh no.)
