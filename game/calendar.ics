SUMMARY:Demon Attack in Feixuzhicheng 
DESCRIPTION:This will likely be two scenes like last time. We can take up to 10 people. If sign-ups go over, we'll prioritize folks who didn't get to go last time.
  
  UPDATE: We'll take everyone EXCEPT those who got to go on the last round AND got to kill things last night (IE, those who have killed demons two of the last two times). So sorry Grace, Calgary, Asher, Joel - next time!
