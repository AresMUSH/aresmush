SUMMARY:Werewolf Movie Night
DESCRIPTION:There was talk of watching werewolf, or giant scary wolf, or maybe adorable dog that eats faces, movies. Quinn has decided that watching movies about these subjects is a very healthy, constructive way of dealing with the current werewolf scare. So she's going to host a movie night full of movies about these subjects. 
  
  Movies:
  Brotherhood of the Wolf
  Ginger Snaps
  Teen Wolf
  
  (Potentially more, maybe less depending on how the night goes)

SUMMARY:Lights, Camera, Action!
DESCRIPTION:Ranger Beau is going up the Mountain to plant a few cameras where they can overlook the sight of the former Banyan tree that (half) the town has been talking about. This is a semi-private event meaning I am looking for 3-5 people who already know something about this IC and would likely be involved in such a mission. Park staff, police officers, scientists and anyone else with a good excuse IC. I work all weekend so I have to do this on Monday but if you're interested and looking for a hook IC mail me, maybe we can figure it out.
  
  P.S. I spent Luck for this scene! Woooo!
