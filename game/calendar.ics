SUMMARY:A Storm Blows In
DESCRIPTION:Kleiosis is known for storms that spring up unexpectedly- and dangerously. Grand Lake mages find out why.
  
  There will be two parts to this: 
  
  1) Social background, where you can RP getting caught in the storm and hunkering down in the below-ground portions of Kleiosis with the others who are stuck there. Anyone can participate in this. You'll be stuck from Wednesday mid-day until Thursday evening, ICly. 
  
  2) Combat for Ray, Erik, and up to 3 others who would have been observing the lay of the land from the wall's ramparts as the storm blew in. Priority will be given to characters who haven't had GM'd activity lately.
  
  Please note which you're signing up for in your RSVP! 
  
  GM: Nessie

SUMMARY:At the Stochi Ballet
DESCRIPTION:The creatures of Stochieion put on a performance of their own take on the human artform of ballet, to celebrate the Festival of Unification and the debut of the native dancers - under the tutelage of humans Ray and Lisette. Come for the dancing, stay for the Spirit.
  
  This event will have no combat or risk but there'll be Spirit magic escapades and dancing.

SUMMARY:Grand Opening of MMA Gym
DESCRIPTION:Brandon's new MMA gym is fully functional. Octagon cages are up and operational. This is a party for mages only to celebrate the finishing of the gym and kiss Rowan on the cheeks for finishing it. If people want to fight in the cages, that can definitely happen but this will mostly probably be a party.
