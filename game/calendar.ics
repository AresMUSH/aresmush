SUMMARY:Runestone Moving Services
DESCRIPTION:A team of mages has been assembled to move the runestone from the battlefield next to the wolf portal to Khepri and Chionet's tomb. So far, Jonathan, Manny, DeLuz, Fenris, and Dani are all planning to help out. 
  
  This will be an open RP event for those who want to help or just want to come for the fun of it. Please feel free to join us, even if it's just to stand on the ground and provide commentary! (Though, if you see us from the ground, we've probably failed at least one part of it, so oh no.)
