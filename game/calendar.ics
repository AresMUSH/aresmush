SUMMARY:Santa Ice Maze
DESCRIPTION:On Friday the 18th the SANTA ICE MAZE will be up and running at the Training Fields. Many dummies will be dressed up and sacrificed in the name of Christmas Silly Times. Boozed up drinks as well as not boozed up drinks will be offered.
  
  In the days leading up to this, everyone is welcome and encouraged to hang out at the fields and get involved in the maze building process in whatever way best suits their skill set! This is all just for fun, so don't overthink it too much. After the event, what remains of the maze will be allowed to hang out until it melts or Erik gets tired of a bunch of random stuff littering his field. Whichever comes first.
  
  Disclaimer: No Real Santas Will Be Harmed
