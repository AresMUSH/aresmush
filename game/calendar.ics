SUMMARY:Bar Room Blitz
DESCRIPTION:Tempers are heating up as tourists spend money to come up to Grand Lake and cannot manage to get out and ski, snowboard, snowshoe, sled, or... well, much of anything. Things come to a head in Grumpies, where someone takes a swing and a bar brawl breaks out. Please sign up so that I can arrange enough dirty tourists to threaten people.
