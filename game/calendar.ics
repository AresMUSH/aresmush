SUMMARY:Maureen's Halloween Masq! (Part 1)
DESCRIPTION:Maureen Silva is having a Halloween Masquerade at the Carver House! Come as your best dressed self, either in a fancy gown or get up with a masq, or come costumed to the brim. Whatever floats your boat. All within the weird community are welcomed.
  
  UPDATE: I'm pushing this two weeks back but I am going to back date the scenes for Halloween; I've been so, so very looking forward to this event all year long. With the death of the dog I need to give myself time to grieve.

SUMMARY:The Wild Hunt (OPEN, RSVP)
DESCRIPTION:On the last night of Samhain, a green-ish fog rolls through the town of Grand Lake, Colorado. Local news reports discuss how spooky it is, arriving on the heels of Halloween's departure. And wouldn't it be great if it had shown up a few days earlier? 
  
  Several of Grand Lake's mages find themselves on the streets of Grand Lake: near the beach, and outside the Lariat.
  
  This event is the kick off to a mini-plot arc that's going to last 2-3 weeks. I'm going to aim to wrap us in TWO but the third is just for some wiggle. I plan to abscond with a handful of PCs by the end of the night, so if you're signing up for this event, you're OOCly consenting to me possibly snagging you. These PCs will be able to RP with each other throughout the course of the plot, but will be away from the rest of the grid and will not be able to contact or RP with them for the duration, so keep that in mind when deciding whether you'd like to volunteer. 
  
  If you'd like to attend but do NOT want to absconded with, please let me know, either via @mail or by noting so on the event. I don't want to over-spook anyone.
  
  For those of you who can't make the event, but decide later that you'd like to be absconded with, you're free to off-game your PC being taken!
  
  Note: I'm not too worried about how many signs up we get, but RSVPing will be helpful for me to prep for. Thanks. :)
