SUMMARY:Pet-A-Palooza
DESCRIPTION:
  Seeing as Grand Lake has no shelter for domestic animals, about twice a year a few adoption groups make the drive out for a pet fair. Doggos? Kittehs? Burbs? Sneks? You betcha. There may even be guinea pigs and lizards. Basically anyything you could reasonably find at a rescue. Come find that special friend!
  
  Disclaimer: This is being created as a purely social scene, HOWEVER staff is welcome to interject plot if it suits them. If players have PRP stuff they want to bring to it, please warn me in advance. :)
  %RAll pet interactions should be emitted by those who attend and be presented in a reasonable fashion. No, you can't have a pet komodo dragon, or monkey, or emotional support velociraptor.

SUMMARY:In Honor Of Angus
DESCRIPTION:Teagan is holding a funeral for a cow, to respect his life. The news of this is probably sure to get around quickly, especially since she's not going to be especially shameful about telling anyone and everyone she knows. No formal invitation this time, and it's alternatively at Sage & Thyme Ranch or Andrade Ranch, depending if you are local or a newcomer.
