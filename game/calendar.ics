SUMMARY:Aftermath
DESCRIPTION:Those who remain, react. 
  
  OOC: This will be largely set-up for Beta, and so there are a few things that Must Happen and a few characters who won't be here. I'm not gonna get spoilery, but if you want to know before Saturday's scene, feel free to page me and I'll spill. I don't want anything to be OOCly frustrating for folks, so if you're the sort who'd rather be prepared, just let me know.
