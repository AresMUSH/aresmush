SUMMARY:Festival of the Heavens (Casting Out the Darkness)
DESCRIPTION:A kind of a ‘New Year’ festival, beginning at sunset. The residents of Kleiosis gather to remind themselves of their history and honor their ancestors. They clean and repair the acropolis and city below it, sweeping away the bad luck from the year before and welcome in good luck. All night, residents will drink, share stories of those who have passed, and watch the stars.

SUMMARY:Festival of the Heavens (Bringing Forth of the Sun)
DESCRIPTION:The second part of ‘New Year’ festival, beginning at dawn. The residents of Kleiosis celebrate the ‘birth’ of the sun and welcome new possibilities with it. They gather to watch the sunrise then have a ‘breakfast’ feast. The day will then be spent giving offerings for the coming year, having mock battles to ‘scare’ away enemies, and smashing pomegranates against thresholds for good luck.

SUMMARY:Maureen's NOT-BIRTHDAY Beach Party
DESCRIPTION:There's something to be said for being held back from your own masquerade birthday party and needing to reschedule, only to be kidnapped by Faeries the next day. Needless to say, Maureen's rescheduled masquerade didn't happen.
  
  Now she's making up for it by having a NOT BIRTHDAY party at the Beach Portal. All members of the Weird are welcome. Masq's and costumes not required, but don't forget to bring the bathing suit if you want to go swimming!
  
  There are rumors of tiki decorations being provided. Food will be provided, having someone to grill the meat would be welcomed. Trust Maureen, you don't want her to grill.
