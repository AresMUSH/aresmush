AresMUSH
========

Virtual reality and 3D games may be the next big thing, but for almost thirty years, players have been creating their own online worlds using nothing but words and their imaginations on MUSHes. A MUSH is a multi-player online game that blends creative writing, improv acting, and role-playing into a unique interactive storytelling experience. 

AresMUSH is a next-gen server platform that brings modern features to MUSH games: a fully-featured web portal and wiki, automated scene logging, web-based character creation, and more. With AresMUSH, you can launch your own MUSH game with no coding experience.
