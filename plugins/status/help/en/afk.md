# Going AFK

The AFK command is used to mark yourself "away from the keyboard", in cases where you need to dash off to take care of something in real life.  You can specify an optional message (like "grabbing dinner, back at 9 EST") about why you're AFK. AFK status (and the AFK message) can be cleared by returning IC or OOC.

> **Tip:** AFK messages are automatically displayed in pages and room descs.

`afk [<note>]` - Marks yourself away from the keyboard, with an optional message.
`afk off` - Cancels your AFK.  Going IC or OOC will also do this.
