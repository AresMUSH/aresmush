# Player Bits

Sometimes players like to make a character just for OOC purposes, to keep page and channel chatter away from their PCs.  These are called `Player Bits`.   Often a player bit's will mirror their player handle name, but this is not required.

If you have such a character, you can mark them as a player bit so the code knows that they're not a real IC character.  That way they won't show up in things like census.

`playerbit <on or off>`
