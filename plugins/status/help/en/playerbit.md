# Player Bits

Some characters are OOC-only.  This can include ancillary staff like builders or coders, and other "player bits" that people use to keep page and channel chatter away from their PCs.  It is helpful to mark these characters as OOC so they don't show up in things like census.

`playerbit <on or off>`
  
Admins or characters with the manage\_status permission can also set other players as player bits:

`playerbit <name>=<on or off>`
