#RandomScene

Gives you a variety of prompts for RP when the creative well runs dry. It will provide you with an RP location and either 1) A random scenario or 2) a prompting word for each person.

`randomscene [<name> <name>]` - Generates a random RP prompt and sends it to both the enactor and those names listed.
`randomscene [<name> <name>]/[area]` - Generates a random RP prompt with a location in the selected area.

By default, some private and OOC areas may be omitted from results. You may still specify these areas in this version of the command.
