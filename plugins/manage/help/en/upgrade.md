# Upgrading the Code

Depending on the scope of the code changes, Ares has the capability to upgrade the game from within the game itself.  The Release Notes for a given Ares version will tell you whether you can upgrade using the in-game commands or whether a game restart is required.  

> Note: If you're upgrading through multiple versions at once (e.g. from 1.2 to 1.6) you should check each version for specific upgrade notes.

See [Upgrading the Code](https://aresmush.com/tutorials/manage/upgrades.html) for detailed instructions.

`upgrade/start` - Begin an upgrade. (If you have custom code, make sure your branch is updated and conflicts resolved first. )
`upgrade/finish` - Completes an upgrade (unless a restart is required).
