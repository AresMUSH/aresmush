# Turning Trolls to Statues

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role.

The statue command, similar to RHost's FUBAR flag or Penn's @toad, can deter trolls whose goal is to be sitebanned.   When you turn a player into a statue, they will be unable to use any commands at all - not even to quit.

`statue <name>=<reason>`

If for some reason you change your mind, you can un-statue them.

`unstatue <name>=<reason>`
