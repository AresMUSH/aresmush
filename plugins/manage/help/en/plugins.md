# Managing Plugins

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the manage\_game permission.

Plugin code, help files, configuration files and translation (locale) files are all stored on disk on the server. 

## Enabling and Disabling Plugins

Certain plugins are designated optional. These can be easily turned on and off without affecting the rest of the game. See [Plugin Config](https://aresmush.com/tutorials/config/plugins.html) for details.

To enable or disable optional plugins, go to the web portal under Admin->Setup->Enable or Disable Plugins.

## Installing Plugins and Themes

[Community Contributions](/help/community_contribs) offer additional plugins and themes for you to install.

## Loading Plugin Code

See [Loading Code](/help/manage/load).
