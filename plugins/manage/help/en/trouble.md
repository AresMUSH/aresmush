# Dealing With Trouble

Unfortunately, you will sometimes have to deal with troublesome players.  These commands will help.

## Booting Trolls

If someone is causing a ruckus, you can forcibly disconnect them.  See [Boot](/help/boot) for more info.

> It is preferable to let the game admin deal with problem players.  However, if they are unavailable, the Ares default configuration allows all approved characters to use the boot command.  This helps players protect each other even when an admin is not around. 

## Monitoring Pages

Ares does not have a 'SUSPECT' flag in the way you might be used to from other MU* servers.  Instead, individual players can [monitor pages](/help/page) from a troublesome player and include that as a verified log when submitting a complaint.

## Admin Tools (Suspects, Bans and More)

Game admins have additional tools to protect the game against troublesome players.  See the [Trolls Tutorial on aresmush.com](http://aresmush.com/tutorials/manage/trolls) for details.
