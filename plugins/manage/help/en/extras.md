# Installing Plugins

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the manage\_game permission.

Several plugins are available in the [Ares Extras](https://github.com/AresMUSH/ares-extras/) repository, including officially-supported extensions and community contributions.  You can install them directly from the game:

`plugin/install <name>`
  
> **Note:!** Many plugins require some additional manual install steps.  Be sure to check the README file associated with each plugin for detailed information on installation and configuration.
