# Names and Aliases

All characters have a one-word moniker called their "name".  This can be their first name, last name or nickname depending on the game's naming policy.

Up until the point when you're approved, you can change your name.

`rename me=<new name>` - Changes your name.

After you're approved, only admins can change your name.  This is because changing your identity may confuse people, and may mess up things like wiki page references.

## Setting an Alias

A character can also have a single nickname/alias.  You can use it anywhere that you use a character's name.

`alias <name>` - Sets your alias.  Leave blank to clear it.
