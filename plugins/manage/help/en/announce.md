# Announcements

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the announce permission.

Many important game announcements will be posted to the bulletin board system so they can be read later by people who aren't online at that moment.  But sometimes you need to make an announcement to just the players who are online.

`announce <message>` - Announces something to all logged-in characters.
