> **Permission Required:** These commands require the manage_game permission.

The game maintains a log file of important events and errors that can greatly help when troubleshooting.  You can view all log files on the web portal (go to Admin -> Logs) or via the server shell (in the `aresmush/game/logs` directory).   For quick reference, you can view the most recent log entries in-game using the log command.

`log` - Views the most recent entries in the game log.
