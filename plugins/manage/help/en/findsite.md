# Finding Player Site Info

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the manage\_game permission.

The findsite command will help you find out a character's IP and hostname.  It can also highlight characters with similar IP address, which may be alts of one another.

> **Tip:**  Many internet providers use dynamic/block IP addresses, which means that some players who live geographically close to each other (including, obviously, roommates) may end up with the same host name or IP.

`findsite` - Shows a site summary identifying possible alts by hostname.
`findsite <name, host or IP>` - Shows someone's IP address and any similar ones.  

You can search for partial sites as well, so 'verizon.com' will find all sorts of Verizon subnets.
