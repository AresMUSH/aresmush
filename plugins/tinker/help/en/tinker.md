# Tinkering

> **Permission Required:** Tinkering with the code requires the Coder role.

The tinker command can be used to run custom code snippets.  For example, let's say you really quickly wanted to find all the characters whose names start with "G".  There's no admin command for that, but you can whip up a quick tinker for it.

1. Go to the web portal's Admin screen.  
2. Select 'Tinker'.
3. Add your code to the 'handle' method.
4. Click Save.
5. Back in the game window, run the `tinker` command.
6. Return to the web portal and click 'Reset Tinker Code' to restore the tinker code to its original template.
