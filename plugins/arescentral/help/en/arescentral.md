# AresCentral

[AresCentral](http://arescentral.aresmush.com/) is the social hub for AresMUSH. 

At AresCentral, players can manage their Player Handles and preferences.   They can also view the AresCentral directory of all Ares games.

Your game will automatically register itself with AresCentral when you set it "public" in the game configuration.  Until then, Player Handle functionality will be disabled.  Admins can manually register a private game to enable Player Handles:

    game/register - Registers a private game with AresCentral. (Admins only)
