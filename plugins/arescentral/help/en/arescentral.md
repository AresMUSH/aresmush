# AresCentral

[AresCentral](http://arescentral.aresmush.com/) is the social hub for AresMUSH.  It helps connect players and games.

[[toc]]

## Game Directory

AresCentral has a directory of all public AresMUSH games.  You can browse game advertisements, see activity graphs, and view player profiles.

Private games do not appear on the AresCentral game directory, but they can still leverage other AresCentral features if an admin registers the game. See [Game Directory](/help/game_directory) for more information.

## Player Handles

AresCentral Player Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing.  A handle is your OOC identity, used across all Ares games. Through your handle, people can identify you as a player, not just as a character.

Having a handle does nothing until you **link** a character to it. This basically tells everyone that you play that character. It also allows access to handle features from that character. More on that in a moment.  Linking is optional; you can pick and choose which characters you want to link.  

> **Tip:** All linked characters are publicly visible. Think of them them as cross-game public alts. All friendships are also publicly visible, like on Facebook.  Unlinked characters will remain anonymous (though of course your IP address still identifies you to game admins).

### Linking Characters to Your Handle

Linking a character is a multi-step process:

1. Log into or create your [AresCentral](http://arescentral.aresmush.com/) account.
2. In AresCentral, select My Account -> Manage Characters -> Get a New Link Code.
3. In the game, enter the link code on your account page (usually under Help -> Account) or use `handle/link <handle name>=<link code>`.

You can unlink your character from your handle at AresCentral.

### Linked Character Features

Having characters linked enables various features:

* Your handle name appears next to your character name when you talk on channels.  (e.g. `Cate (@Faraday) says...`)
* Several preferences (autospace, timezone, client settings, etc.) can be set once on AresCentral and automatically shared across all your linked characters.
* You can mark other player handles as your friends, and that will carry over to all your linked characters.
* Reading a forum post on one character will mark it read for all other linked characters.
* You can easily switch between linked characters on the web portal, or pose as all your characters in a scene.
* And more...
