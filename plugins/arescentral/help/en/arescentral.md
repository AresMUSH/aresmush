# AresCentral

[AresCentral](http://arescentral.aresmush.com/) is the social hub for AresMUSH.  It helps connect players and games.

## Player Handles

AresCentral Player Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. For more information and help on creating your handle, see: [AresMUSH Handles Tutorial](http://aresmush.com/handles/).

Having a handle is only useful once you `link` characters to it.  This tells the game which characters on which games are yours.  Linking is optional; you can pick and choose which characters you want to link.  Unlinked characters will remain anonymous (though of course your IP address still identifies you to game admins).

Linking a character is a multi-step process:

1. Log into or create your AresCentral account.
2. Select My Account -> Manage Characters -> Get a New Link Code.
3. In the game, use `handle/link <handle name>=<link code>` to complete the link.

Autospace, quote/page colors and timezone preferences are automatically downloaded from your AresCentral character to each of your linked characters when you log in.

## Game Directory

AresCentral also has a directory of all public AresMUSH games.  You can browse game advertisements, see activity graphs, and view player profiles.
