# AresCentral - Player Handles

Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. For more information and help on creating your handle, see: [AresMUSH Handles Tutorial](http://aresmush.com/handles/).

To create or manage your handle, visit [AresCentral](http://arescentral.aresmush.com/).

Having a handle is only useful once you `link` characters to it.  This tells the game which characters on which games are yours.  Linking is optional; you can pick and choose which characters you want to link.  You will need a link code from AresCentral.  When you have it, you can do:

`handle/link <handle name>=<link code>`

Autospace, quote/page colors and timezone preferences are automatically downloaded from your AresCentral character to each of your linked characters.
