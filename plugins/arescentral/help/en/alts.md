# Alternate Characters

AresMUSH considers "alts" to be charactrs who are linked to your %xhplayer handle%xn (help handles).   Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read bbposts and mail notifications.  See [Handles](/help/handles) for more information.

Handles are completely optional!  If you don't have a handle, you must register alts manually on the wiki as described here: http://bsgu.aresmush.com/players
