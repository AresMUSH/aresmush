# Alternate Characters

AresMUSH considers "alts" to be charactrs who are linked to your %xhplayer handle%xn (help handles).   Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read bbposts and mail notifications.  

Handles are completely optional!  

> Be aware that your handle is your OOC identity, shared across all Ares games.  Having a handle and linking character to it is always 100% optional!  See [Handles](/help/handles) for more information.

If you don't have a handle, you must register alts manually on the wiki as described here: http://bsgu.aresmush.com/players.
