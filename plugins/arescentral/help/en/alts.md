# Alternate Characters

AresMUSH considers "alts" to be characters who are linked to your [player handle](/help/handle).  Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read forum posts and switching easily between characters on the web portal.

> Be aware that your handle is your OOC identity, shared across all Ares games.  Having a handle and linking characters to it is always 100% optional!  See [AresCentral](/help/arescentral) for more information.

## Registering Alts With Tags

If you don't want a player handle, you can alternately register alts by adding a [content tag](/help/tags) on your character's web portal profile.  Just edit your profile and find the 'tags' box.  Enter a tag in the form `player:<playername>`. "Playername" can be either your main character's name or some other moniker used to tie your characters together.
  
> **Note:** A tagged alt does not have access to all the same alt features that a handle-linked character does. This is for your security. Any game admin can edit player tags. Linking an alt to your player handle requires verification from your AresCentral account.
