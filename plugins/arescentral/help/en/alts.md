# Alternate Characters

AresMUSH considers "alts" to be charactrs who are linked to your %xhplayer handle%xn (help handles).   Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read bbposts and mail notifications.  

> Be aware that your handle is your OOC identity, shared across all Ares games.  Having a handle and linking character to it is always 100% optional!  See [Handles](/help/handles) for more information.

Because handles are never mandatory, your game may have other ways for you to declare if you have multiple characters (a request or wiki page, for instance.)  Consult your local game policies for details.
