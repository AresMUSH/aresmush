# Alternate Characters

AresMUSH considers "alts" to be characters who are linked to your %xhplayer handle%xn (help handles).   Linking your alts publicly to your handle gives you access to various features, like automatically tracking read forum posts and switching easily between characters on the web portal.

> Be aware that your handle is your OOC identity, shared across all Ares games.  Having a handle and linking character to it is always 100% optional!  See [AresCentral](/help/arescentral) for more information.

If you don't want a player handle, you can alternately register alts by adding a profile tag to your character's web portal profile.  Just edit your profile and find the 'tags' box.  Enter a tag in the form `player:<playername>`. "Playername" can be either your main character's name or some other moniker used to tie your characters together.
