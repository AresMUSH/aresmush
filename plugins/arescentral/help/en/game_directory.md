# AresCentral - Game Directory

AresCentral has a directory of all public AresMUSH games. 

> Learn about the game directory in the [AresCentral Tutorial](/help/arescentral).

You can manage your game directory information in the web portal under Admin -> Setup -> Game Directory Information.

Your game will automatically register itself with AresCentral when you set it "public" in the game configuration.  

## Private Games

Private games do not appear on the AresCentral game directory, but they can still leverage other AresCentral features if the game is registered with AresCentral.  Only players with a character on the game will see details for a private game on AresCentral. Admins can register a private game with AresCentral using the `game/register` command. 

`game/register` - Registers a private game with AresCentral. (Admins only)
