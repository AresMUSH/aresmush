# AresCentral - Game Directory

AresCentral has a directory of all public AresMUSH games. 

> Learn about the game directory in the [AresCentral Tutorial](/help/arescentral).

You can manage your game directory information in the web portal under Admin -> Setup -> Game Directory Information.

Your game will automatically register itself with AresCentral when you set it "public" in the game configuration.  Until then, Player Handle functionality will be disabled.  Admins can manually register a private game to enable Player Handles:

`game/register` - Registers a private game with AresCentral. (Admins only)
