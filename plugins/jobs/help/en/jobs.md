# Jobs

The Jobs system is used by the game administrators to track work requests and to-do items.  Players can submit their own requests.

> **Working with jobs requires the access_jobs permission.**
> Note:  Some games will have multiple staff roles with limited access to certain categories.  For example - builders may only be able to access the 'BUILD' category.  You can still create jobs in other categories, but they are treated as _requests_ (see [Requests](/help/request)).

## Viewing Jobs
`jobs` - Lists jobs
`job <#>` - Views a job.
`jobs/all` - Shows all jobs, even old ones.  Add a number after 'all' to see additional pages (e.g. jobs/all2, jobs/all3, etc.)

`jobs/catchup` - Marks all jobs as read.
`jobs/catchup <number>` - Mark a specific job as read.

## Filtering  Jobs
`jobs/filter <fliter>` - Filters the jobs list.
`jobs/mine`, `jobs/active` - Shortcuts for the common filters.

Valid filters are:

* Active - Jobs that are active (not done or on hold) and/or have new activity since you last looked.  This is the default filter.
* Mine - Active jobs assigned to you.
* Unfinished - All jobs not marked done.
* (Category Name) - Active jobs in the given category.
* All - All jobs.

## Creating Jobs

Jobs can be created by players using the `request` command, by coded systems (e.g. apps), or manually.

`job/create <title>` - Creates a new job (REQ category)
`job/create <title>=<category>/<description>` - Creates a new job
        Default categories are APP (Applications), BUILD (Building), CODE, MISC, RP and REQ (Request).
`job/query <player>=<title>/<description>` - Submit a request on behalf of someone.

## Multi-Character Jobs

You can add multiple participants to a single job.  All participants will be able to see and comment upon the job.

`job/addparticipant <#>=<name>`
`job/removeparticipant <#>=<name>`

## Changing Job Status

`job/assign <#>=<player>`
`job/handle <#>`
`job/cat <#>=<category>`
`job/status <#>=<status>`
`job/title <#>=<title>`
        Status values are NEW, OPEN, HOLD (job on hold) and DONE.

## Adding Job Comments
`job/discuss <#>=<comment>` - Comments on a job (only admins may view)
`job/respond <#>=<message>` - Comments on a job (admins and submitter may view)
`job/deletereply <#>=<reply#>` - Deletes a reply.

`job/mail <#>=<recipients>/<message>` - Sets a response (admins and submitter may view) on the job and sends that response in mail to the recipients.

Admins can convert a mail message into a job.

`mail/job <#>` - Turns a mail message into a job request.

## Closing Jobs
`job/close <#>` - Closes a job
`job/close <#>=<message>` - Closes a job with a comment to the original submitter.

## Old  Jobs
