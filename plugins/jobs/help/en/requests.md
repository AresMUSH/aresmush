# Requests

The Request system is used to submit requests to the admins. You can track the status of your request, as well as who it's assigned to.

`request <title>=<description>` - Submits a request
`requests` - Views your active requests
`requests/all` - Views all of your requests, even closed ones.  

`request <#>` - Views details of a request.
`request/respond <#>=<comment>` - Adds a comment to a request.

> **Tip:** You can see multiple pages with requests2, requests3, etc.  This works with switches too, like requests2/all, requests3/all, etc.

## Requests/Jobs and Mail

Job requests are preferred over mail as a means of communicating with the game admin.  The jobs system does not normally send you a mail message when your request is updated.  All activity is logged in the job itself.
