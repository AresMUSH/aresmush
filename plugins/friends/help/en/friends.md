# Friends

The Friends system helps you to interact with people you have designated as your friends.

`friends` - Shows your friends list.
`friend/add <name>` - Adds a friend.
`friend/remove <name>` - Removes a friend.
`friend/note <name>=<note>` - Adds a note to your friend.

You can use the friends list to control whose connect/disconnect messages you see.  See [Watch](/help/watch).

> **Tip:** If you have an AresMUSH Player Handle, you can add other handles as your friends at AresCentral.  This carries over to all your Ares games.  See [AresCentral](/help/arescentral).
