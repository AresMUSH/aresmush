# Friends

The Friends system helps you to interact with people you have designated as your friends.

`friends` - Shows your friends list.
`friend/add <name>` - Adds a friend.
`friend/remove <name>` - Removes a friend.
`friend/note <name>=<note>` - Adds a note to your friend.

You can use the friends list to control whose connect/disconnect messages you see.  See [Watch](/help/watch).

If you have an AresMUSH Player Handle, you can add other players as your friends at AresCentral.  This carries over to all your Ares games.  The friends command will then show you which characters your friends are playing, and all of their characters are automatically considered friends.  For more information on player handles, see: [AresMUSH Handles Tutorial](http://aresmush.com/handles/).
