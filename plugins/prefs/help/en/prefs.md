# RP Preferences

The preferences command lets you record your roleplay interests (or disinterests) and find similarly-minded players.  Each game will define the interest categories relevant and available on that game (e.g. combat, politics, etc.).  Players can then indicate their preference as:

* yes (+)
* no (-) 
* it depends (~)

In addition to the +/-/~ setting, you can optionally record a note with additional details.

> Note: Unless your game is full-consent, setting a preference to 'no' does not necessarily mean you'll never have to deal with it.  Consult your local game policies for details.

`prefs [<player>]` - Views someone's preferences.  Leave off the name to view your own.
`pref/set <category>=<setting +, -, ~>[/<note>]` - Sets a preference.  
  Leave the setting blank to remove it.
`pref/note <notes>` - Sets general notes for your preferences.
`prefs/find <category>[/<setting>]` - Search for preferences within a given category.
  You can specify only people with a particular preference setting.

This system is inspired by the +prefs system designed by Cobaltasaurus@MSB.
