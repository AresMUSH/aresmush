## Going Onstage and Offstage

The game is divided into an "onstage" area and an "offstage" area, like an imaginary theater.  These areas are also known as the IC (In Character) or OOC (Out of Character) areas.

Onstage areas are where the game scenes happen.  Offstage areas are for administration and socializing.  You can get back and forth from these areas using the onstage/offstage commands.  

`onstage` - Travels to the IC area.
`offstage` - Goes OOC to the offstage area.

> **Tip:** Onstage will always go back to your last IC position.  If you ever get stuck OOC and can't get back to the IC zone, you can always reset yourself using `onstage/reset`.
