# The Grid

The MUSH grid consists of **Rooms** (virtual locations) connected by **Exits**.  This is called the **Grid**.

The Grid is only important when you're playing via a MU client, because your character object is _always_ in a single room.  When you're playing through the Web Portal, your room is irrelevant.  You can join any number of scenes, irrespective of their rooms.

## Moving Around The Grid

The room description shows available exits and their destinations.  For example:
  
      [N] Green Hills

You can use the `go` command to move through an exit, or just use the exit name as a shortcut.  For example:  "go n" or simply "n".

`go <exit name>` or `<exit name>` - Move through an exit
  
## Grid Shortcuts

There are several shortcut commands for moving around the grid without going through exits.

* `meetme` extends an invitation to another player so you can join each other.
* `onstage` and `offstage` take you to the IC and OOC areas.
* `home` and `work` let you 
* `teleport` is usually limited to admins and builders, but lets you hop to any room or player.
