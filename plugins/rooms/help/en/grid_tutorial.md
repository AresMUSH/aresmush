# The Grid

The MUSH grid consists of **Rooms** (virtual locations) connected by **Exits**.  This is called the **Grid**.

The Grid is most important when you're playing via a MU client, because your character object is _always_ in a single room.  When you're playing through the Web Portal, you can join any number of scenes, irrespective of their rooms. These scenes can draw their locations from rooms on the Grid or from temporary rooms that exist ICly (say, a random patch of forest in the Rocky Mountain National Park) but which may not have a permanent room and desc.

On Spirit Lake, we don't consider your character's location to be IC until you have established that it is. You are welcome to wander the grid without ICly being in those rooms.

You can also explore the grid on the web portal via the [Locations Directory](/locations), and see a [map of IC locations](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1Iw2hd57g__fAY9PugKUXtnTLRSiVzZ3B&ll=40.25257593479522%2C-105.83243883803587&z=15) in Grand Lake.

## Moving Around The Grid

The room description shows available exits and their destinations.  For example:

      [N] Green Hills

You can use the `go` command to move through an exit, or just use the exit name as a shortcut.  For example:  "go n" or simply "n".

`go <exit name>` or `<exit name>` - Move through an exit

## Grid Shortcuts

There are several shortcut commands for moving around the grid without going through exits.

* `meetme` extends an invitation to another player so you can join each other.
* `onstage` and `offstage` take you to the IC and OOC areas.
* `home` and `work` let you
* `teleport` lets you hop to any room. `rooms` will give you a list of all rooms matching a partial name.
