> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the go_home permission.  By default in Ares, this permission is given to everyone.  Some games may restrict it.

The `home` command lets you return quickly to a place of your choosing on the game.  You can choose any room to be your home, IC or OOC, so your home could be your character's IC residence or the Off-stage room, or anywhere you like.  Please be considerate, though, and don't use other peoples' private rooms as your home location without their permission.

There is a companion command, `work`, that lets you quickly access your workplace.

`home/set` and `work/set` - Sets your home/workplace to your current location.
`home` - Go home.
`work` - Go to work.
