# Home

The `home` command lets you return quickly to a place of your choosing on the game.  Your home should usually be your character's IC residence, but may change during plots.  There is a companion command, `work`, that lets you quickly access your workplace.

`home/set` and `work/set` - Sets your home/workplace to your current location.
`home` - Go home.
`work` - Go to work.
