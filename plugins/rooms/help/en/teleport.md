# Teleport

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the teleport permission.

The teleport command lets you jump around the grid without using the exits.  You can jump to a room by ID or by name, or use a player name to join them.

`teleport <destination>` - Teleports yourself.
`teleport <list of names>=<destination>` - Teleports a character.

> **Tip:** If you have multiple rooms with the same name, you can use Area/Room - for instance Uptown/Bar.

If you're not sure of the room name or ID, you can use the rooms directory command.

`rooms` - Shows all rooms and their database IDs.
`rooms <name>` - Searches for a room matching the given name.
