# Locking Exits

If you're in an interior room (defined as one with an "O" out exit), you can lock and unlock the outside door (i.e. the one leading INTO the room from the outside) for privacy.

`lock`
`unlock`

These locks are temporary.  The game periodically clears the locks on empty rooms.

Builders can also set up permanent role-based locks.  See [Building](/help/building).
