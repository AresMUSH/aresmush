# Meetme

The meetme command is used to hook up with other players for RP.  You can easily join another player's location or bring them to you.

`meetme <list of names>` - Invites others to join you.
`meetme/bring` - After receiving an invitation, bring them to you.
`meetme/join` - After receiving an invitation, go to them.

You can also teleport to a room or join a scene:
`scene/join <#>` - Joins a scene.
`teleport <destination>` - Teleports yourself.

See [teleport](/help/teleport) and [scenes](/help/scenes) for more information.
