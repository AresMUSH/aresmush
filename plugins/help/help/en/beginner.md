# What is a MUSH?

A MUSH is a multi-player online game that blends creative writing, improv acting and role-playing into a unique interactive storytelling experience.  Players create and control characters in a shared story.  Like a video game, a MUSH provides a virtual world for the characters to inhabit.  It just uses text instead of graphics to describe the characters, locations and action.  Like a tabletop RPG, there are rules to keep things fair.

## Connecting and Registering

If you're reading this, you must be connected to the game - either through a web browser using the game's **web portal**, or through a MUSH-specific app called a **MU Client**. Most features are equally accessible via both web and client, but some features are client-only.

The web portal works like any other web application. Most games will have a [Register](/register) link at the top where you can register a new character. Otherwise, you'll need to create your character using the client (described below).

To connect with a MU Client, first download one of the many [MU client apps](http://www.aresmush.com/clients.html) and connect using the hostname and port number located on the home page (for example: somegame.com port 4201). From the login screen, you would type `create <name> <password>` to register a character and `connect <name> <password>` to log in.

## How to Play

If you've never played before, you may want to check out the [MUSH 101 tutorial](https://aresmush.com/mush-101) for a detailed walkthrough. In broad strokes, though, you will:

1. Register a character, as described above.
2. Flesh out that character's details in a process called **Character Generation** (or chargen for short). Most games require some sort of review and approval of your character before you can play.
3. Join the story by participating in **Scenes** with your character. In a scene, each player takes turns writing their character's actions and dialogue. In MU lingo these are called **poses**.  Scenes take place in locations (called "Rooms" in MUSH lingo) that represent the virtual game world.

## Getting Help

Use the [Help System](/help) to learn about MUSH commands. If you're using the web portal, you can just click on the link. If you're in a MU client, type `help`.

You can ask questions on the [Chat System](/help/chat).  Most games have a dedicated new player or questions channel.

You can use the [page](/help/page) command to send private messages to other players who are connected.  The [Game Administrators](/help/admin), the people who run the game, are there to help.

Good luck and have fun!
