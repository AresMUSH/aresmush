# Help System

The MUSH help system is here to help you learn how to use the in-game commands.  You can view help articles on either the web portal (typically under Help -> Game Help) or via the help command.

> Learn more about the help system in the [Help Tutorial](/help/help_tutorial).

`help, help2, help3, etc.` - Shows each page of help topics.
`help <topic name or keyword>` - Searches the help and shows the full help text.
`help/quick <command name>` - Views quick command syntax.
`qr <command name>` - Views quick command syntax.

> **Tip:** If you're viewing help inside the game, the hyperlinks will appear in plain text like: "See Connecting to the Game (/help/login/connect)".  You will have to type `help login connect` (without the slashes) to view that help file.  If you're reading help on the web portal, you can just click the link.
