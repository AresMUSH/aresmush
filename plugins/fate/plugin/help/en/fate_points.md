# Fate Points

Fate Points provide your character an edge in sticky situations and power certain stunts.  Admins award fate points for special situations, and your points will refresh at some interval determined by the game admin.

> Note: The fate points spend command just records the fact that you spent points; you have to manually include their effects in your next roll.
