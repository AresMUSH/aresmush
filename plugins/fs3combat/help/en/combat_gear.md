# FS3 Combat Gear

There are various kinds of gear that can be used in combat.  You should only use gear that is appropriate to the IC situation.

Equipping gear does not take a turn unless it is accomplished by spell or potion.

`weapons` - List all non-magical weapons.
`weapon <name>` - See details for a particular weapon. Works with magical weapons.
`combat/weapon <name+specials>` - Sets your weapon.

`armor` - List all non-magical armor.
`armor <name>` - See details for a particular armor type. Works with magical armor.
`combat/armor <name+specials>` - Sets your armor.
