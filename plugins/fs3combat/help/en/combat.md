# FS3 Combat

The FS3 Combat system is designed to bring some order to the chaos of large combat scenes, managing ability rolls and tracking damage in an automated fashion.

To learn how FS3 combat works, you should read the [FS3 Combat Player's Guide](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/combat) and try out the [Interacive Combat Walkthrough](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/combat-walkthrough).

There is also an online [Quick Reference](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/combat-quickref) to the most common combat commands.

## Actions
> **Tip:** You can always specify a NPC or player name in front of any action command to make them do something.  For example, combat/join Bob=#123.  You need the equals sign even if there are no command options.  For example, combat/pass Bob=
>
> Most commands support multiple names as well, so you can do: combat/attack A B=C

`combat/pass` - Take no action this turn.

`combat/stance <stance>` - Sets stance for your actions.  You can use `combat/stances` to see a list of possible stances.

`combat/attack <target>[>mod:<mod>] OR [>called:<hitloc>]`
    Specials are optional. Use commas to separate multiple options.
    * mod:<special modifiers> - Dice to add or subtract to the roll.
    * called:<location> - Perform a called shot to a particular hit location.
       Use `combat/hitlocs <target>` to see a list of valid hit locations.


`combat/explode <list of targets>` - Use an explosive weapon.

`spell/cast <spell>` - Casts a spell that doesn't need a target.
`spell/cast <spell>=<target>` - Casts a spell that needs a target.
`potion/use <potion>` - Uses a potion.

`combat/distract <target>` - Distracts a target
`combat/subdue <target>` - Subdues or disarms a target.
`combat/escape` â€“ Attempts to escape while subdued.
`combat/aim <target>` - Takes careful aim.

`combat/treat <name>` - Treat an injured person's worst treatable wound. (requires medicine)

## Gear
There are various kinds of gear that can be used in combat.  You should only use gear that is appropriate to the IC situation.

## Luck

Luck points (see [Luck](/help/luck)) have special effects in combat.

### Bonus Dice

`combat/luck <attack, defense or initiative>` - Spend a luck point to get +3 bonus dice this turn.

> **Tip:** Spending luck on attack affects special attacks like explosions or suppression.  It also conveys a bonus to damage.

### Avoiding Knockout

## Damage
`damage` - Views your damage.
`damage <name>` - Views someone else's damage.

The healing progress bar on the damage display shows how close you are to reducing the wound by one level.

`combat/treat <name>` - In combat, treats someone's wounds with immediate first aid.
`treat <name>` - Treats someone's wounds with immediate first aid.

`heal/stop <name>` - Removes a patient.
`heal/list` - Shows your patients.
`heal/scan` - Find injured patients who might need your services.

## Hospitals
When a room is marked as a hospital, people who are there heal faster.

Admins, combat organizers, and characters with the manage_combat permission can add or modify damage.

`damage/delete <name>/<damage #>` - Deletes damage.
