# FS3 Combat

The FS3 Combat system is designed to bring some order to the chaos of large combat scenes.

> Learn how the combat system works in the [Combat Tutorial](/help/fs3combat_tutorial).

## Actions

>
> Most commands support multiple names as well, so you can do: combat/attack A B=C
>
>You can target mythics as well as
