# Luck in Combat

Each turn, you can spend a [Luck Point](/help/luck) to get +3 bonus dice to either attack, defense or initiative.  You can only spend luck on one of them per turn, so make sure it's something relevant to what you're going to do that turn.

`combat/luck <attack, defense, initiative, or spell>` - Spend a luck point this turn. Only one may be active at a time.

## Avoiding Knockout

You can also spend a luck to avoid a knockout.  This doesn't erase the damage, it just lets you soldier on in spite of it.

`combat/hero` - Spends a luck point to un-KO yourself and receive a small amount of healing.

> **Tip:** Before spending luck, remember that in some situations another player may be able to revive you with a rally, treat, or spell.  You might want to give them a chance first and save your luck for a more dire situation.
