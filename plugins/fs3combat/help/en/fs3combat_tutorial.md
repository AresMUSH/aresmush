# FS3 Combat

The FS3 Combat system is designed to bring some order to the chaos of large combat scenes, managing ability rolls and tracking damage in an automated fashion.

## Starting and Joining Combats

You can start or join a combat either from the web portal (usually under Directory -> Combats) or the `combat/start` and `combat/join` commands.

> **Tip:** All combats must be associated with a scene.  The scene and combat are automatically linked up the first time someone in a combat poses, or you can do it manually with the `combat/scene` command.

When participating in a combat scene via the web portal, you'll probably want to have one browser tab open to the combat page and another for the scene page, since both contain important information.
