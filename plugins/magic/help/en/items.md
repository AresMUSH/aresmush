#Magical Items
Magical items range from weapons enchanted to cause increased damage to amulets that provide protection to staves and wands used to focus magic. Only one magical item may be equipped at a time. See [Magical Items](/wiki/magical_items) for more information.

`items [<name>]` - See the items owned by a character and what they have equipped.
`item/equip <item>` - Equip an item.
`item/uneqip <item>` - Unequip an item.
`item/give <name>=<item>` - Give an item to someone.

**Admin Only**
`item/add <name>=<item>` - Add an item to someone.
`item/remove <name>=<item>` - Remove an item from someone.

Note that temporary NPCs cannot use magical items. To use a magical item, NPCs need to be character objects. See [help NPCs](/help/npc).
