# Tracking IC Relationships

The relationships command lets you keep track of IC relationships your character has.  (For OOC friends, see [Friends](/help/friends).) You can provide a category for each relationship, like "Acquaintances", "Friends", etc.   You can track relationships with NPCs too - just make sure their name doesn't overlap with a PC name.

## Adding and Editing Relationships

You can add and edit relationships on the web portal or in-game.  See [Editing Your Web Profile](/help/web_profile) for more.

`relationships` - Sees your relationships.
`relationships <name>` - Sees someone else's relationships.
`relationship/add <name>=<category>/<details.` - Adds a relationship.
`relationship/update <name>=<category>/<details.` - Updates a relationship.
`relationship/delete <name>` - Deletes a relationship.

## Organizing Relationships

Relationships can be organized into categories.  You can set the order that the categories are displayed in.  On the web portal, you can also edit the order of individual relationships within a category.

`relationship/move <name>=<new category>` - Moves a relationship to a new category.
`relationships/order <list of categories separated by commas>`
