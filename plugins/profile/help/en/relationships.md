# Tracking IC Relationships

The relationships command lets you keep track of IC relationships your character has.  (For OOC friends, see [Friends](/help/friends).) You can provide a category for each relationship, like "Acquaintances", "Friends", etc.   You can also track relationships with NPCs too - just make sure their name doesn't overlap with a PC name.

> **Note:**  All relationships are public and can be seen by anyone.  Please don't get bent out of shape if someone has an unflattering or inaccurate opinion of your character.  It's just IC.

## Managing Relationships on the Web Portal

You can add and edit relationships on the web portal.  See [Editing Your Web Profile](/help/web_profile) for details.

## Adding and Editing Relationships

If you prefer to manage your relationships in-game, you can do so.

`relationships` - Sees your relationships.
`relationships <name>` - Sees someone else's relationships.
`relationship/add <name>=<category>/<details.` - Adds a relationship.
`relationship/update <name>=<category>/<details.` - Updates a relationship.
`relationship/delete <name>` - Deletes a relationship.

## Organizing Relationships

Relationships can be organized into categories.  You can set the order that the categories are displayed in.  On the web portal, you can also edit the order of individual relationships within a category.

`relationship/move <name>=<new category>` - Moves a relationship to a new category.
`relationships/order <list of categories separated by commas>`
