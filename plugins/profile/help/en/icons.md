# Setting a Profile Image

Your **profile image** is the picture featured on your profile page.  To set your profile image:

1. Click the "Files" button at the bottom of the profile page and upload the image to your character's folder.
2. Edit your profile and find the "Profile Image" field.
3. Select the image to use as your profile image.

## Image Sizing Tips

* Square icons work best.
* 600x600 pixels is a nice size, though it could be larger or as small as 300x300.
* Keep the face close to the top of the image - don't leave a lot of empty space above the head.
* Leave some of their shoulders or upper chest in the image so there's room at the bottom for the name tag.

> **Tip:** You can resize your images and make them square using free online tools like [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/create/).

## Customizing Your Small Profile Icon

Your **profile icon** (or sometimes "log icon") is a smaller profile image used across the web portal in scene lists, forum posts, and more. By default, the game will use a scaled-down version of your profile image for your icon.  Sometimes this doesn't look right, and your icon will appear squished.  If this happens to you, you can use a separate image for your profile icon.

To upload a separate profile icon:

1. Click the "Files" button at the bottom of the profile page and upload the image to your character's folder.
2. Edit your profile and find the "Profile Icon" field.
3. Select the image to use as your profile icon.

The same sizing tips apply to the profile icon as the profile image.  See "Image Sizing Tips" above.
