Each character has a **character profile** showing various information.

You can view character profiles on the web portal (typically under Directory -> Characters) or using the `profile` command.

> **Note:** Any IC information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

## Custom Profile Fields

The basic fields in your profile will be set up as part of character creation (see [Demographics](/help/demographics)).  You can also set custom profile fields for extra things like notes, quotes, etc.  These will show up on your web page profile; they're too spammy to show in-game.

Custom profile fields can use [Markdown](/help/markdown), including images and links.

## Profile Gallery

You can display image files in a gallery on the bottom of your web profile page.  To do so:

1. Click the "Files" button at the bottom of the profile page and then click "Choose Files".  
2. Choose the files to upload and select the "Upload" button for each.

> **Tip:** Please be considerate and don't upload giant hi-res images - 1200x600px is the max you should need.  You can resize your images using free online tools like [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/create/).  Games may set limits on the size of individual image files, and the total size of all files on your page. 

By default, your gallery will show all images you upload, in alphabetical order.  If you want to customize this:

1. Edit your profile and find the "Profile Gallery" field.
2. List the images you want to show in your gallery, space-separated in the form `folder/file.png folder/file2.png`.

To delete files from your gallery, click on it to open its file page, and select "Delete".

## Profile Images and Icons

Your **profile image** is the picture featured on your profile page.  You can select any file in your profile gallery to be your profile image.  You can optionally select a different image for your smaller **profile icon** used in scenes and elsewhere throughout the web portal.  See [Icons](/help/icons) for tips on sizing your icon and detailed instructions for uploading and setting them.

## Relationships

Your profile also tracks IC relationships your character has.  (For OOC friends, see [Friends](/help/friends).) You can also track relationships with NPCs too - just make sure their name doesn't overlap with a PC name.

> **Note:**  All relationships are public and can be seen by anyone.  Please don't get bent out of shape if someone has an unflattering or inaccurate opinion of your character.  It's just IC.

Relationships can be organized into categories, like "Acquaintances", "Friends", etc.  You can set the order that the categories are displayed.  On the web portal, you can also edit the order of individual relationships within a category.
