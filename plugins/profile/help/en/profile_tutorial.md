Each character has a **character profile** showing various information.

You can view character profiles on the web portal (typically under Directory -> Characters) or using the `profile` command.

> **Note:** Any IC information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

## Custom Profile Fields

The basic fields in your profile will be set up as part of character creation (see [Demographics](/help/demographics)).  You can also set custom profile fields for extra things like notes, quotes, etc.  These will show up on your web page profile; they're too spammy to show in-game.

Custom profile fields can use [Markdown](/help/markdown), including images and links.

## Profile Gallery

You can display image files in a gallery on the bottom of your web profile page.  To do so:

1. Click the "Files" button at the bottom of the profile page and then click "Choose Files".  
2. Choose the files to upload and select the "Upload" button for each.

> **Tip:** Your game may set limits on the size of individual image files, and the total size of all files on your page.

By default, your gallery will show all images you upload, in alphabetical order.  If you want to customize this:

1. Edit your profile and find the "Profile Gallery" field.
2. List the images you want to show in your gallery, space-separated in the form `folder/file.png folder/file2.png`.

To delete files from your gallery, click on it to open its file page, and select "Delete".

## Profile Image and Icon

Your **profile image** is the picture featured on your profile page.  To set your profile image:

1. Upload the image to your profile gallery as explained above.
2. Edit your profile and find the "Profile Image" field.
3. Select the image to use as your profile image.

Various places on the website will use a mini version of your profile image, which is known as your **profile icon** (or sometimes "log icon"). The web portal will try to scale down the profile image as best it can, but sometimes it just doesn't look right.  If this happens to you, you can upload a dedicated profile icon for your character.

1. Upload the image to your profile gallery as explained above.
2. Edit your profile and find the "Profile Icon" field.
3. Select the image to use as your profile icon.

The following tips will help you get your icon showing up right:

* Square icons work best.
* 300x300 pixels is an ideal size, though it can be larger.
* Keep the face close to the top of the icon - don't leave a lot of empty space above the head.
* Make sure there's room at the bottom for the name tag.

## Relationships

Your profile also tracks IC relationships your character has.  (For OOC friends, see [Friends](/help/friends).) You can also track relationships with NPCs too - just make sure their name doesn't overlap with a PC name.

> **Note:**  All relationships are public and can be seen by anyone.  Please don't get bent out of shape if someone has an unflattering or inaccurate opinion of your character.  It's just IC.

Relationships can be organized into categories, like "Acquaintances", "Friends", etc.  You can set the order that the categories are displayed.  On the web portal, you can also edit the order of individual relationships within a category.
