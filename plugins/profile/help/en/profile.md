# Character Profile

Each character has a **character profile** showing various information.  Any IC information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

## Viewing Profiles

`profile` - Views your profile.
`profile <name>` - Views someone's profile.

## Managing Your Profile

The basic fields in your profile will be set up as part of character creation (see [Demographics](/help/demographics)).  You can also set custom profile fields for extra things like notes, quotes, etc.  These will show up on your web page profile; they're too spammy to show in-game.

Custom profile fields can use [Markdown](/help/markdown), including images and links.

`profile/add <field>=<value>` - Adds or updates a custom profile field
`profile/delete <field>` - Deletes a custom profile field
`profile/edit <field>` - Snags the field into your input buffer, if
       your client allows.  (see [Editing](/help/edit))

If you have a handle, people viewing your character profile will also see a link to your OOC handle profile (see [Handles](/help/handles) for more info.)

## Setting Relationships

You can also track IC relationships in your profile.  See [Relationships](/help/relationships).
