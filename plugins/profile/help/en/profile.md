# Character Profile

Each character has a **character profile** showing various information.  Any IC information is provided for OOC reference; do not use it inappropriately if you have no IC reason to know it.

## Viewing Profiles

`profile` - Views your profile.
`profile <name>` - Views someone's profile.

## Managing Your Profile

The basic fields in your profile will be set up as part of character creation.  You can also set custom profile fields for extra things like notes, quotes, etc. by using the Web Portal.

## Setting Relationships

You can also track IC relationships in your profile.  See [Relationships](/help/relationships).
