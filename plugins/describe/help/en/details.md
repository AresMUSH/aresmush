# Detail Commands

Details can be used to keep more detailed views separate from the main description.  

> Learn more about details in the [Descriptions Tutorial](/help/descriptions_tutorial).

`detail/set <name>=<detail title>/<description>`
`detail/delete <name>/<detail title>`
`detail/edit <name>/<detail title>` - Grabs the existing detail into your input buffer.

You view details using the regular look command:

`look <name>/<detail title>` - Looks at a detail on something.
