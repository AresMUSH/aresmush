# Detail Commands

Details can be used to keep more detailed views separate from the main description.  For example, if your character has a ring, you might create a really detailed description of that ring and put it in a "Ring" detail.  You could also do this for signs, notes, and other landmarks in rooms. 

> Learn more about details in the [Descriptions Tutorial](/help/descriptions_tutorial).

Use a character name, room name, 'me', or 'here' for the name.

`detail/set <name>=<detail title>/<description>`
`detail/delete <name>/<detail title>`
`detail/edit <name>/<detail title>` - Grabs the existing detail into your input buffer.

You view details using the regular look command:

`look <name>/<detail title>` - Looks at a detail on something.
