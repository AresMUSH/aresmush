# Outfits

The `outfit` command lets you manage multiple outfits for your character.  Typically you'll define one base outfit for your character's body description, and then have a variety of mix-and-match clothing outfits for your different clothes and accessories.

`outfits` - Lists outfits
`outfit <name>` - Views an outfit.
`outfit/set <name>=<description>` - Creates a new outfit, or replaces an old one.
`outfit/delete <name>` - Deletes an outfit.

You can wear a combination of outfits using the `wear` command.  This will set your description to the selected outfits.

`wear <list of outfits>` - Wear outfits.
