# Description Commands

Every character, room and exit has a description that tells you what your character sees when they look around.

> Learn the basics of descriptions in the [Descriptions Tutorial](/help/descriptions_tutorial).

`describe <name>=<description>` - Describes something
`describe/edit <name>` - Grabs the existing description into your input buffer. (See [Edit Feature](/help/edit).)

`shortdesc <name>=<description>` - Sets a short desc.
`shortdesc/edit <name>` - Grabs an existing short desc into your input buffer.

`desc/notify <on or off>` - Notifies you when someone looks at you. (MU client only)

## Outfits and Details

You can store multiple descriptions with the [Outfits](/help/outfits) commands, and have expanded [Details](/help/details) (like jewelry or tattoos).
