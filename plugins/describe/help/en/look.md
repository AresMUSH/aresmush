# Looking Around

The `look` command is used to look around.  You can also look at a particular object or a detail on an object.

`look <name>`
`look`  (shortcut for looking at 'here')
`look <name>/<detail>` - Looks at a detail on something.

`glance` - Get a quick summary of everyone in your room, including some demographics.

## Description Notifications

By default, the game will not notify you if someone looks at you. (the @adesc feature from other MU servers.) You can turn it on:

`desc/notify <on or off>` - Turn the 'looked at you' notification on or off.
