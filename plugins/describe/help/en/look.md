# Looking Around

The `look` command is used to look around.  You can also look at a particular object or a detail on an object.

`look <name>`
`look`  (shortcut for looking at 'here')
`look <name>/<detail>` - Looks at a detail on something.

## Glancing

The `glance` command gives you a quick summary of everyone in your room.  This will show some of your demographic information and your short description.

`glance` - Takes a quick look at everyone in your room.

## Description Notifications

By default, the game will notify you if someone looks at you. (the @adesc feature from other MU servers.) If you don't like that, you can turn it off:

`desc/notify <on or off>` - Turn the 'looked at you' notification on or off.
