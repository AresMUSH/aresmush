# Chat Tutorial

There are two main ways to chat with other players:

* Channels are like chat rooms, geared around specific topics (questions, general chit-chat, group-related messages, etc.)
* Private Messages (aka pages or PMs) are shared with only a select player or group of players.

## Channels

You can see available channels and their descriptions using the `channels` command or the Chat page on the web portal.  Choose which channels you want to join, and you'll see messages from those channels.  The `channels` command also shows the commands used to talk on the channels you've joined when using a MU client..

MU client channels:

    <Questions> Ryan has connected.
    <Questions> Faraday (@Faraday) says, "Hiya Ryan."
    <Questions> Ryan says, "Hi!"

Some key features you can do on channels:

* Set channel aliases for quicker commands when chatting in a MU client.
* Review old messages on a channel.
* Mute channels temporarily to avoid spam when RPing.
* Report channel abuse.

## Private Messages

On the web portal, private messages appear on the Chat page alongside channels.  They are differentiated by `<PM>` in front of their names. You can start a new conversation by clicking the "New Conversation" button and then selecting the players you want to talk to.
  
In a MU client, private messages use the `pm` or `page` command: `pm <names>=<message>`.
  
    <PM> (to Faraday) Cate says, "Hi there."
    <PM> (to Cate) Faraday (fara) says, "Good evening!"

With private messages, you can also:

* Put yourself in 'do not disturb' mode or block specific players from contacting you.
* Send messages to players even if they're offline or on the web portal.
* Customize how your page messages are formatted on the MU client view.
* Report abusive messages.

> **Note:** Ares does not provide admins with a command to view private messages.  However, be aware that any data transmitted to the server and/or stored in the database is accessible to the game owner and anyone they choose to share it with.
