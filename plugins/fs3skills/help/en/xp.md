# FS3 - Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) are gained weekly to reflect what your character has been learning and/or practicing during that time.  You spend them to improve your abilities.  

You earn 3 XP per week, and can store up to 9. You can learn skills and attributes once every 4 weeks, and spells once a week.

For more help with xp and learning costs, see the [XP Guide](http://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/xp).

`learn <ability>` - Spends XP to learn an ability.
`xp` - Shows your progress towards the next rating level.

`spell/learn <spell>` - Spends XP to learn a spell
`spells` - Shows spells you are learning and how much XP is still needed.

> **Tip:** If you ever mess up an XP spend, like by typing the wrong skill name, an admin can help you reset it.
