# FS3 - Experience Points

Experience Points (XP) are gained periodically to reflect what your character has been learning and/or practicing during that time.  You spend them to improve your abilities.  

> Learn how the FS3 skills system works in the [FS3 Tutorial](/help/fs3).

`learn <ability>` - Spends XP to learn an ability.
`xp` - Shows your progress towards the next rating level.
`xp/costs` - Reviews XP costs.

> **Tip:** If you ever mess up an XP spend, like by typing the wrong skill name, an admin can help you reset it.
