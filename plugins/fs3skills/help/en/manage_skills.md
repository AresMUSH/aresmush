# Managing FS3 Skills

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the permission: manage\_abilities

Those with the proper permissions can adjust skills, luck and XP.

## Viewing Sheets

Some games may have multiple pages of the character sheet, and some pages might be configured to be private.  Private sheets can only be viewed by people with the `view_sheets` permission.

`sheet <name>`

## Roll Results

Roll results can be sent to a channel, configured in the FS3Skills settings.  Storytellers can join that channel in order to judge situations even without being in the room.  The roll command will also let you roll for other people, if storytellers prefer to roll something privately.

## Adjusting Skills

You can adjust skill levels:

`ability <name>=<ability>/<rating>`

To remove a skill, just set its rating to 0.

You can also adjust specialties:

`specialty/add <name>=<ability name>/<specialty>`
`specialty/remove <name>=<ability name>/<specialty>`

## Awarding Luck

See [Manage Luck](/help/manage_luck).

## Managing XP

See [Manage XP](/help/manage_xp).
