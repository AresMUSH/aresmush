# FS3 Skill Commands

You can set your skills during character creation via the web portal or the ability commands explained below.  After you're approved, you can only improve skills with [Experience Points](/help/xp).

> Learn how the FS3 skills system works in the [FS3 Tutorial](/help/fs3).

## Reset to Start

To get started in chargen (or to start over), use the reset command.

`reset` - Resets your abilities, setting default values based on your groups.  **This will erase any abilities you have, so do this first!**

## Setting Abilities

`abilities` - Lists available abilities.
`sheet` - Views your character sheet.

`raise <name>` and `lower <name>` - Raise or lower an ability by 1 level.
`ability <name>=<level>` - Sets an ability to a specific rating.
`specialty/add <ability>=<specialty>` or `specialty/remove <ability>=<specialty>` - Add or remove an action skill specialty.

## Finding People With Skills

`skill/scan <specific skill name>` - Find people with that skill.
`skill/scan <action, background, language>` - Summarize peoples' skill levels. Only skills held by 2 or more people are shown to cut down on spam.
