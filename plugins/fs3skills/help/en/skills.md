# FS3 Skills

This game uses the FS3 skills system, Third Edition.  The complete rulebook can be found online: [FS3 Player's Guide](http://www.aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3).

`sheet [<name>]` - Shows a sheet.

`abilities` - Lists all abilities.
`attributes` - Lists attributes.
`skills` - Lists skills & schools
`languages` - Lists languages

## Finding Other People With Skills

If you're looking for a character with a specific skill, you can use the skill scan command.  It will list anyone with that skill above Everyman (or above Average for attributes).  People in your room are highlighted.

`skill/scan <name>`
`skill/scan <type>` - Show everyone's rating for a type of skill (action, background, language). Background only shows those skills 3 or more people have.
