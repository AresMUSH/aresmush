# FS3 Skills

This game uses the FS3 skills system, Third Edition.  The complete rulebook can be found online: [FS3 Player's Guide](http://www.aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3).

`sheet [<name>]` - Shows a sheet.

`abilities` - Lists all abilities.
`attributes` - Lists attributes.
`skills` - Lists skills & schools
`languages` - Lists languages

## Finding Other People With Skills

If you're looking for a character with a specific skill, you can use the skill scan command (if the game has enabled visible sheets).  It will list anyone with that skill above Everyman (or above Average for attributes).  People in your room are highlighted.  You can also see a summary of people within the different skill categories.

`skill/scan <specific skill name>` - Find people with that skill.
`skill/scan <action, background, language>` - Summarize peoples' skill levels. Only skills held by 2 or more people are shown to cut down on spam.
