# FS3 - Luck

Luck Points in FS3 can be used to generate various lucky breaks.  Luck points are earned through cookies (see [Cookies](/help/cookies)).  You can view your available luck points on your character sheet.

You can use luck points for combat, ability rolls, or other plot points at the storyteller's discretion.  See [FS3 Player's Guide](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/luck/) for more information.

`luck/spend <reason>` - Spends luck outside of combat.
    See [Combat Luck](/help/combat) for combat-related luck commands.
