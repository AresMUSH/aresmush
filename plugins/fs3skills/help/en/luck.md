# FS3 - Luck
> Learn how the FS3 skills system works in the [FS3 Tutorial](/help/fs3).

Luck Points are special points that you can spend in various ways to perform better in combat, avoid death, increase your chance in rolls, create potions, increase your chance to stumble on plot points, and more.

Luck is awarded in several ways:

* **Participation in scenes.**  You get a fraction of a luck point for each scene participant.  There are bonuses for RPing with someone for the first time, and for RPing with a new player.  There are diminishing returns if you always RP with the same people.
* **Giving and receiving compliments.** You earn 1/4 luck point for both giving and receiving a compliment.
* **OOC work.** You can earn luck by as GMing scenes, running plots, and updating the wiki.

Players can bank up to 6 Luck Points at a time.

See [Luck](http://shatteredmu.com/wiki/system:luck_points) for more information on how to earn Luck Points and how you can spend them.
