# FS3 - Luck

Luck Points in FS3 can be used to generate various lucky breaks.  Luck points are earned by participating in scenes.  You can view your available luck points on your character sheet.

You can use luck points for combat, ability rolls, or other plot points at the storyteller's discretion.  See [FS3 Player's Guide](http://aresmush.com/fs3/fs3-3/luck.html) for more information.

Luck is awarded for participation in scenes.  You get a fraction of a luck point for each participant.  There are bonuses for RPing with someone for the first time, and for RPing with a new player.  There are diminishing returns if you always RP with the same people.  Admins can also issue luck as rewards.

`luck/spend <reason>` - Spends luck outside of combat.
    See [Combat Luck](/help/combat) for combat-related luck commands.
