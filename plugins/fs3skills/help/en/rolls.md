# FS3 - Ability Roll Commands

You can use the roll command to make ability rolls.

> Learn how the FS3 skills system works in the [FS3 Tutorial](/help/fs3).

`roll <ability>` - Rolls an ability.
`roll <character>/<ability>` - Makes a roll for someone else.
`roll/private <ability>` - Shows results only to yourself.
`roll <character>/<ability> vs <character>/<ability>` - Makes an opposed roll.

Except for private rolls, all rolls may be emitted to a special roll results channel so admins and storytellers not in the room can see results.
