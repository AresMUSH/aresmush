# FS3 - Ability Roll Commands

You can use the roll command to make ability rolls. 

> Learn how the FS3 skills system works in the [FS3 Tutorial](/help/fs3).

`roll <roll options>` - Rolls an ability.
`roll <character>/<roll options>` - Makes a roll for someone else.
`roll/private <roll options>` - Shows results only to yourself.
`roll <character>/<roll options> vs <character>/<roll options>` - Makes an opposed roll.

In all cases, `<roll options>` can be a combination of ability, ruling attribute, modifiers, or NPC dice.  For example, `roll Firearms` or `roll Firearms+Wits-1` or `roll 4` (which rolls ability 4+attr 2). For details and examples, see the [tutorial](/help/fs3).
  
Except for private rolls, all rolls may be emitted to a special roll results channel so admins and storytellers not in the room can see results.
