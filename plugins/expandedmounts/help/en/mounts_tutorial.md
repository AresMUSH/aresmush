## Mythics in Combat

Mythics may only join a combat (`combat/mount <name>`) if their bonded partner is in the combat. Once a mount has been added to the combat by their partner, others may mount the mythic as a passenger. This has no system effects and is for RP purposes only.

The mythic/mage pair get one action per round. This action can be attacking with the mythic's weapons (typically claws or teeth), casting a spell, or attacking with a suitable human weapon such as a bow. Weapons are always equipped by the mage, even if they are a mythic weapon.

Because mythics and their bonded partners act in unison in times of high intensity, there is never a situation when both mythic and mage would take separate combat actions, even if the mage is not mounted. The mythic may act, or the mage may act, but not both.

This unison also means that certain stats are always averaged between the mount and the mythic. Defense, attack, initiative, composure, and stealth rolls are always an average between the two - even if the mage is not mounted. In combat, this averaging is automatic.

Mages and mythics also share the impact of attack, initiative, lethality, defense, and spell mods. This includes mods gained by spending luck points, taking damage, acquiring stress, or via magic. They also share stances and magic shields.

Mundane actions such as attacking and treating can target the mythic or the mage. Magic attacks, armor, armor special, and healing spells can use the mythic as a target; all other spells must target the mage.

When mounted, there is a chance that any attack aimed at the mythic may hit its passengers, and any attack aimed at the mage may hit the mythic.
