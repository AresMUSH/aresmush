## Mythics in Combat

In combat, mythics are vehicles. Their bonded partner is the 'pilot', and all defense rolls use the pilot's reflexes skill.

The mythic/mage pair get one action per round. This action can be attacking with the mythic's weapons (typically claws or teeth), casting a spell, or attacking with a suitable human weapon such as a bow. 

Because mythics and their bonded partners act in unison in times of high intensity, there is never a situation when both mythic and mage would take separate combat actions, even if the mage is not mounted.
