# Ranks

Ranks are used in military or paramiltary organizations.  The Ares ranks system differentiates ranks by groups (see [Groups](/help/groups)).

## Quick Reference

`ranks` - Shows groups with ranks
`ranks <group>` - Shows ranks for a given group. 

As part of character creation, you can set your rank.

`rank/set <rank>` - Sets your rank  (leave rank blank to clear it)

Admins and people with the `manage_ranks` permission can set someone else's rank, including restricted ranks that are not available in chargen.

`rank <name>=<rank>`
