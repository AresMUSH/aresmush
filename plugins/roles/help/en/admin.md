# Game Administrators

The game administrators, sometimes called "admin" or "staff", are the people behind the curtain - the ones who keep the game running smoothly.  You can use the `admin` command to see who they are. 

> **Tip:** Please refrain from paging admins who are marked as 'off duty' unless it's urgent.  If your problem is not immediate, you may also consider using the [Requests](/help/request) system to submit a general request rather than contacting a specific admin.

`admin` - Shows game admins.

Admins can set their position (or whatever note they want to show on the admin list) by using:

`admin/position <position>` - Sets your position.
