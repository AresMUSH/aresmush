# Game Administrators

The game administrators, sometimes called "admin" or "staff", are the people behind the curtain - the ones who keep the game running smoothly.  You can use the `admin` command to see who they are.

`admin` - Shows game admins.
`admin/position <position>` - Sets the position/description that appears in the admins list. (admins only)

Admins can mark themselves as on or off-duty in this list using the [Duty](/help/duty) command.

> **Tip:** If an admin is off-duty or offline, you can use the [Requests](/help/request) system to contact them.
