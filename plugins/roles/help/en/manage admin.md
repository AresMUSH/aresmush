# Admin Positions

The `admin` command lists all game admins.  It automatically finds people based on whether they have one of the roles you have defined as an admin role in your game config.  

You can also set a position to appear next to your name on the admins list, describing your role/position.

`admin/position <position>` - Sets your position.
