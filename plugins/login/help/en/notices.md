# Notifications

When you log in, you'll be alerted if you have any personal notifications. This includes mail messages, private messages (pages) you missed when you were offline, replies to your requests or jobs you're handling, and activity in your scenes. You can review your notifications in detail:

`notices` - Shows notifications
`notices/catchup` - Marks all notifications as read.
