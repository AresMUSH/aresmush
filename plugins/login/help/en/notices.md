You always see the notices screen when you connect, which shows you a summary of important messages and what's new to read on the game (like mail or forum posts).  If you miss it, you can see it again:

`notices` - Shows login notices.

You can optionally run additional commands when you first connect, after the notices.  Players may want to do this to automatically say a channel greeting, or run 'who' or 'jobs' when they connect.

`onconnect <comma-separated list of commands to run when you connect>`
