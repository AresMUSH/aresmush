# Notifications

When you log in, you'll be alerted if you have any personal notifications. This includes mail messages, private messages (pages) you missed when you were offline, replies to your requests or jobs you're handling, and activity in your scenes. You can review your notifications in detail:

`notices` - Shows notifications
`notices/catchup` - Marks all notifications as read.
Viewing your notifications will automatically mark them as read. You can still view 'read' notifications with the notices command, but you won't be alerted about them when you log in.

`onconnect <comma-separated list of commands to run when you connect>`
