# Privacy

It's up to each individual Ares game to determine their privacy policies.  Ideally this will be conveyed to players in the terms of service acknowledgement or a policy file on the wiki. If there isn't one, nag your game admins. It's important. It may even be the law, depending on where your game is running and/or where your players are from.

For **general** information about how data is stored in Ares, see [Data and Privacy on Ares Games](https://aresmush.com/game_privacy.html). Bear in mind that your game may have custom code that modifies this core behavior.

For AresCentral and aresmush.com privacy practices, see the [AresMUSH.com privacy policy](https://aresmush.com/privacy.html).
