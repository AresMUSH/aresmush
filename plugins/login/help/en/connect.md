# Connecting and Disconnecting

You connect to the game through a 'MUSH client'.  There are dedicated apps you can install on your PC/Mac or mobile device, or you can use the game's built-in web client to play through the web browser.  For more help finding a MUSH client or connecting, see the [MUSH 101 tutorial](https://aresmush.com/mush-101).

To get past the game's welcome screen, you need to log in with a character.  

## Touring with a Guest Character

There are a number of 'guest' characters available that you can borrow just to log in and look around.  To use one of them, type:

`tour`

When you connect, the game will tell you your character name:

> %% Your temporary guest character name is Guest-1.

That way, if you see someone addressing 'Guest-1' you'll know they're talking to you.

## Creating a Character

When you're ready, you'll want to create your own character.  Your character name can be your first name, last name, or a nickname.  Some games have traditions for how they prefer to name characters.  Multi-word names are not permitted.  

You should take care to consider the game's setting when choosing your name.  'Starkiller' is probably not an appropriate name for a modern-day MUSH, for instance, and you should avoid well-known fictional character names unless the game expressly allows them.

`create <name> <password>` - Creates a character.

## Connecting to a Character

Once your character is created, you can connect to them from the login screen.

`connect <name> <password>` - Connects to a character.

## Quitting the Game

When you're done, you can quit.

`quit` - Disconnects from the game.
