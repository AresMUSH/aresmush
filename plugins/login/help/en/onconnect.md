# Running Commands on Login

You can optionally run additional commands when you first connect. Often players will want to view the 'where' list immediately upon login, or 'forum/scan' to see unread forum posts. Admins may want to scan the jobs board automatically on login.

`onconnect` - View your onconnect commands
`onconnect <comma-separated list of commands to run when you connect>`
`onconnect/edit` - Grabs your onconnect commands into your input buffer (see [Edit Feature](/help/edit)).
`onconnect/clear` - Reset your onconnect list
