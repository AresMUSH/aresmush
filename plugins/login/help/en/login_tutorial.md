# Logging In

There are two ways to play the game--you can play through the [Web Portal](/help/web_portal) or through a special "MU Client" application installed on your PC/Mac or mobile device. 

> **Tip:** You can find a list of MU client applications in the [MUSH 101 tutorial](https://aresmush.com/mush-101).

## Taking a Tour

You can look around the web portal without being logged in, you just won't have access to join in scenes or edit anything.

To look around using a MU client, you'll need to log in with a character.  If you haven't yet created one, which we'll discuss in a moment, you can borrow a designated "guest" character.  Just log in with the `tour` command and you'll be assigned to a temporary character.

When you connect, the game will tell you your character name:

> %% Your temporary guest character name is Guest-1.

## Creating a Character

When you're ready, you'll want to create your own character.  Your character name can be your first name, last name, or a nickname.  Some games have traditions for how they prefer to name characters.  

> **Tip:** Multi-word names are not permitted in AresMUSH, but some games permit you to set a multi-word nickname that shows up next to your character's name in select places.  For example: `Steve (Captain America)`.

You should take care to consider the game's setting when choosing your name.  'Starkiller' is probably not an appropriate name for a modern-day MUSH, for instance, and you should avoid well-known fictional character names unless the game expressly allows them.

You can create a character from the MU Client welcome screen using the `create` command.  If your game permits it, you can also create a character using the Register link on the web portal home page.

Once your character is created, you can log in using either the Log In button on the web portal, or the `connect` command.

## Quitting the Game

When you're done, you can quit.  Either use the Logout button on the web portal, or the `quit` command.
