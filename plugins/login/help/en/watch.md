# Watching Other Characters Connect

You will always be notified when people log in to the room you're in.  However, it can also be handy to know when people are coming and going across the game.

`watch <all, none, friends, new>` - What connect messages you see for players outside your room. All, none, only your [Friends](/help/friends), or only unapproved/new characters.
`last <name>` - View someone's last online time.
