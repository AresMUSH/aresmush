# Changing Your Password

You can change your password at any time.  If you forget your password and have a player handle (help handles), you can create a temporary one at AresCentral.  If you don't have a player handle, you'll have to log in with a guest character using the `tour` command and contact an admin.

`password <oldpassword>=<newpassword>` - Changes your password.
