# Changing Your Password

You can change your password at any time.

`password <oldpassword>=<newpassword>` - Changes your password.

## Forgotten Password

If you forget your password:

- If you have a player handle (see [Handles](/help/handles)), you can create a temporary password at AresCentral.  
- If you don't have a player handle, you'll have to log in with a guest character using the `tour` command and contact an admin for help.

**Admin Only**
`password/reset <name>` - Will choose a random new password and tell it to you.
