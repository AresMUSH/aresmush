# Idling Out

We hope you'll be with us for a long time!  But RL happens and people drift.  Please be aware of our idle policy, explained on the game wiki.

The fate of idled-out characters is at the game admin's discretion, but we will take into account the wishes of the player and any other players impacted by the character's departure.  If you would like to register a preference on what happens if you ever idle out, use the `lastwill` command.  You could leave your character's fate up to someone else, or specify that they be killed off or sent away.

`lastwill` - Views your last will instructions.
`lastwill <instructions>` - Sets your last will instructions.
  
Admin can view someone's lastwill as part of the idle sweep using the `idle/preview` command.  (See [Idle Sweep](/help/idle_sweep).)
