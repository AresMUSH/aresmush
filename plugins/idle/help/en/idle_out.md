# Idling Out

We hope you'll be with us for a long time!  But RL happens and people drift.  Please consult your game's policies for specific idle criteria.

The fate of idled-out characters is at the game admin's discretion.  f you would like to register a preference on what happens if you ever idle out, use the `lastwill` command.  You could leave your character's fate up to someone else, or specify that they be killed off or sent away.

`lastwill` - Views your last will instructions.
`lastwill <instructions>` - Sets your last will instructions.
  
Admin can view someone's lastwill as part of the idle sweep using the `idle/preview` command.  (See [Idle Sweep](/help/idle_sweep).)
