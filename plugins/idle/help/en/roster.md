# Roster

The roster system allows you to jump into RP more quickly with a ready-made character - often with ties to other players. Some characters have been pre-played, while others are former NPCs.

`roster` - Views a list of rostered characters.
`roster <name>` - Views details about a character.

## Claiming a Roster Character

If a character has been through chargen, you can see their stats and background using the `sheet` and 'bg' commands. 

The roster system will tell you who to contact if you want to find out more info about them, but you do not need anyone's permission to claim most most roster characters. 

When you're ready to take a roster character, you can log in with a guest (using the tour command) and then use roster/claim.  You will be paged with the login password.

`roster/claim <name>` - Claims a character.  

Sometimes characters require a special application, or a chat with the contact person.  These characters are marked with a note on the roster.  Talk to the contact person to claim one of them.
