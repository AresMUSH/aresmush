# Roster

The roster system allows you to jump into RP more quickly with a ready-made character - often with ties to other players. The roster will note if a character has been previously played, if they're approved and ready to go, and if any special permission is required to claim them.

`roster` - Views a list of rostered characters.
`roster <name>` - Views details about a character.

Use the character's web profile or the `sheet` and `bg` commands to view their stats and background.

Claim a roster character through the web portal roster page, or by loging in with a guest character.

`roster/claim <name>` - Claims a character.

Some roster characters are listed on the roster as "requires application", which means you have to submit some additional information to be considered for the character.  You will be prompted with the application details when you use the web portal claim feature, or view the character using `roster <name>`.   If you don't already have a character on the game, be sure to include some kind of contact info (like an email or an alt) so the app staff can contact you if your application is approved.

`roster/claim <name>=<app>`
