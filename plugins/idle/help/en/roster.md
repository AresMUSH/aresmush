# Roster

The roster system allows you to jump into RP more quickly with a ready-made character - often with ties to other players. The roster will note if a character has been previously played, if they're approved and ready to go, and if any special permission is required to claim them.

`roster` - Views a list of rostered characters.
`roster <name>` - Views details about a character.
  
Use the character's web profile or the `sheet` and `bg` commands to view their stats and background.

Claim a roster character through the web portal roster page, or log in with a guest character and use the `roster/claim` command. You'll be given a temporary password for the character.

`roster/claim <name>` - Claims a character. 
  
Some roster characters are listed on the roster as "requires application", which means you have to submit some additional information to be considered for the character. Consult your local game policies and/or the roster contact person for details about the app process and app requirements.
