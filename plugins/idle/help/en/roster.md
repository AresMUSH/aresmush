The roster system allows you to jump into RP more quickly with a ready-made character - often with ties to other characters. Roster characters require a brief application.

To apply, claim the roster. You will receive the character's password and be prompted to enter some information about why you'd like to play that character. Please see our [Roster Policy](/wiki/policies) for information on requesting changes to roster characters.
