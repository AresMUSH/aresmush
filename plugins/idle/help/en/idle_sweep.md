# Idle Sweeping Old Characters

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the permission: manage\_idle.

The idle system lets you sweep the database for players who haven't logged in for awhile, so you can decide what to do with them.

## Idle Sweep

There are several idle actions available:

    Destroy - Get rid of them.  This is the default for unapproved characters.
    Gone - Mark that they've left the IC area.
    NPC - Mark that they're a NPC. 
    Dead - Mark that they're dead.
    Roster - Put them on the roster.
    Warn - Notify them they're in danger of idling out.  This is the default for approved characters.

> **Tip:** We recommend that you **not** destroy idled-out players once they've been approved.  They're part of the IC world.  They might come back, and allowing their name to be re-used can cause confusion.  Plus, removing them will make all messages from them appear from "Author Deleted" and will remove them from scenes.  Database space should really not be an issue.

`idle/start` - Builds up a list of idle players.
`idle` - Review everyone's actions.
`idle/action <name>=<action>` - Decides what to do with someone.
        Note: If someone isn't already on the list, this will add them.
        You can also use idle/gone, idle/warn, etc.
`idle/remove <list of names>` - Removes someone from the list.
`idle/execute` - Takes care of the actions and posts a summary to the BBS.

## Idle Preview

You can get a preview of someone's recommended idle action, and view their lastwill.

`idle/preview <name>` - View idle information without adding someone to the idle queue.
  
## Setting Idle Status Directly

Sometimes you want to immediately idle someone out without going through the whole idle queue process.  You can do this with the `idle/set` command.  Only 'None', 'Dead' and 'Gone' are valid options here.  If you just want to mark someone as a NPC, use the [NPC](/help/npc) command.  To add or remove someone from the roster, use the [Roster](/help/manage_roster) commands.   You can also clear someone's idle status by setting it to 'None'.

`idle/set <name>=<status>` - Sets someone's status without running through the idle queue.
