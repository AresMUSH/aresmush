#Giving luck
Give your luck to another character. Creates a record of the transaction.

Luck may be given for any reason, but once it's gone, it's gone, so give wisely!

`luck/give <name>=<reason>` - Give someone one of your luck points.
`luck/record [<name>]` - See a record of all luck given to a character.
