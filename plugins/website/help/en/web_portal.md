# Web Portal

The game's web portal provides an interface to the game that you can access from any browser. Using the web portal, you can play the game from a browser, browse characters and scenes, manage your character's profile, check mail and forum posts, view the online help and more.

> Note: AresMUSH is supported on Chrome, Safari and Edge.  It will probably work fine in other browsers too, but fixing minor layout issues or other oddities will not be a priority.

`website` - Gives you the address of the web portal.
