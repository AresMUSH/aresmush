# Web Portal

The game's web portal provides an interface to the game that you can access from any browser. Using the web portal, you can play the game from a browser, browse characters and scenes, manage your character's profile, check mail and forum posts, view the online help and more.

> Note: AresMUSH is supported on Chrome, Safari and Edge.  It will probably work fine in other browsers too, but fixing minor layout issues or other oddities will not be a priority.

`website` - Gives you the address of the web portal.

Part of the web portal is the game's wiki, an information repository typically used for theme and policy files.  For more information about using the wiki, see the [Wiki Tutorial](/help/wiki).
