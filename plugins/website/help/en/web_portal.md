# Web Portal

The game's Web Portal provides an interface to the game that you can access from any browser. Using the Web Portal, you can play the game from a browser, browse characters and scenes, manage your character's profile, check mail and bulletin board posts, view the online help and more.

> Note: AresMUSH is supported on Chrome, Safari and Edge.  It will probably work fine in other browsers too, but fixing minor layout issues or other oddities will not be a priority.

Type `website` to get the address to the Web Portal.
