# Setting Your Web Portal Icon

Your **profile image** is the picture featured on your profile page.  

Various places on the website will use a mini version of your profile image, which is known as your **profile icon** (or sometimes "log icon").  

The web portal will try to scale down the profile image as best it can, but sometimes it just doesn't work very well.  If this happens to you, you can upload a dedicated profile icon for your character.

The following tips will help you get your icon showing up right:

* Square icons work best.
* 300x300 pixels is an ideal size, though it can be larger.
* Keep the face close to the top of the icon - don't leave a lot of empty space above the head.
* Make sure there's room at the bottom for the name tag.

Both the profile image and icon can be set by editing your character profile.
