# Content Tags

Content tags are like internet hashtags: a single-word label (you may use hyphens) that lets you organize related content. Many things on the web portal support tags: characters, scenes, wiki pages, forum posts, events, and jobs. 

If a type of content supports tags, you will see an explicit "tags" field when editing. Here you can provide a space/comma-separated list of tags you wish to apply. (Forum posts are special - see below.)

You can view a list of all tags on the web portal under Wiki -> All Tags. Selecting a tag will show you which content contains that tag.

## Tag Privacy

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: **All content tag names are public**.  

Even in private forums or jobs, don't use tags like #nemosucks (unless you want Nemo to know there's a thread about them).

When viewing a specific tag, you'll only see content that you have permission to view. (e.g., private scenes will not show up unless you're in them, nor will forum posts from forum categories you don't have access to).

## Tagging Forum Posts

Forum posts are special. The system will scan the post itself for hashtags. The hashtag must be preceded by a space, and followed by either a space or the end of the message. 

Note: Only original posts are tagged at this time, not replies.

For example:

  tag:   We're having a special #empire-day celebration next week!
  tag:   Join us on Tuesday for festivities. #empire-day
  no tag: Join us on Tuesday for festivities.#empire-day   (there's no space before the hashtag)
  no tag: See http://example.com/holidays.html#empire-day for details. (not a hashtag, it's a link)
  
## Player Tags

Tags in the form `player:NAME` are used to tag alternate characters for players who don't have a player handle. See [alts](/help/alts) for more information.
