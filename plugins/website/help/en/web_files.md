# Uploading Files to the Web Portal

The Ares web portal has a central file repository.  This allows images to easily be used across multiple pages.   You can use folders to organize the images by page name or any other criteria.  Character gallery images will automatically be put into a folder matching the character name.

You can upload and view available files just by visiting the [File Repository](/files).  Click on any file to view or manage it.

> **Tip:** If you want to overwrite/replace an existing file, be sure the 'overwrite' checkbox is checked.

Once an image file is uploaded, you can use it on any page with:

`[[image folder\filename.jpg]]`  

You can also use it in your character profile as explained in .  If you upload something that is not an image, you can link to it like so:

`[Link Text](\folder\filename.jpg)`

See the <a href="/help/markdown">markdown reference</a> for more image formatting options.</p>
