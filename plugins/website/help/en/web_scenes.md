# Managing Scenes from the Web Portal

Scenes shared via the game's [Scenes](/help/scenes) system automatically appear on the web portal.  Private scenes cannot be viewed from the web.

You can edit scenes in th web portal, tweaking the text and scene information (title, summary, etc.)  You can add/remove participants and related scenes.  If a scene is complete, you can edit the scene log.

> **Tip:** Related scenes in Ares automatically link both ways, so you only have to edit one of the two related logs.
