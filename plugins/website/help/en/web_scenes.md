# Managing Scenes from the Web Portal

## Scenes Directory

Scenes shared via the game's [Scenes](/help/scenes) system automatically appear on the web portal's scenes directory.  A shared scene is always publicly visible.

You can edit scenes in th web portal, tweaking the text and scene information (title, summary, etc.)  You can add/remove participants and related scenes.  If a scene is complete, you can edit the scene log.

> **Tip:** Related scenes in Ares automatically link both ways, so you only have to edit one of the two related logs.

## Live Scenes

AresMUSH also shows you scenes that are currently active, and allows you to join in right from the web portal.  You can mix and match web and in-game players, or even play a scene entirely via the web.

Once a scene is complete, you can choose to edit and share the scene.
