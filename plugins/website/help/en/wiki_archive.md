# Wiki Archive

All games come to an end eventually, and when that happens you don’t want to lose your entire website. Ares allows you to export the key bits of the web portal to disk: Characters, Scenes and Wiki.

The export doesn’t fully re-create the web portal, and it’s not perfect. Games with code customizations may need to tweak the exporter to include the right details in their character sheets.

Players can download the archive from the [wiki-archive](/wiki-archive) page.

Admins can create an archive manually using the `website/export` command, or configure the game to run an export automatically every night using the `auto_wiki_export` config option.


## What to Do With Your Archive

If you unzip the archive, you can browse it by double-clicking on the `index.html` file or dragging-and-dropping it into your favorite web browser.

When a game closes, game admins may want to share the export ZIP file with your players using DropBox or another file-sharing service. If you do have your archive available publicly, you may contact Faraday to have it linked to the [AresCentral game archive](https://arescentral.aresmush.com/wiki).
