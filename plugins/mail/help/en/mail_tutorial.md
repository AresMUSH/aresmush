# Mail Tutorial

The mail system lets you send messages to other players.  You can read and send mail from the web portal's mail screen (typically under Play->Mail) or the `mail` command.

Just like with regular email, you can send messages to multiple players at once, forward messages (with or without an added comment), and reply to a message.

Instead of folders, Ares mail uses `tags`, which are a sort of label used to organize your mail.  There are several special tags:  

* **Inbox** - Incoming mail.
* **Sent** - If you've enabled the sent-mail feature, saves a copy of mail you've sent.
* **Trash** - Mail you've marked for deletion.
* **Archive** - Mail you've archived to keep it from cluttering up the inbox.

You can make your own custom tags as well to organize your messages as you desire.

Filtering mail shows only messages matching a certain tag. There are common filters defined for the special tags.  For example, to see your sent mail you can either click the 'Sent' filter on the web portal or use the `mail/sent` command.
