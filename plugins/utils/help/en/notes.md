# Notes

You have a built-in notepad for your character, where you can record whatever notes you like.  There are three sections of notes:

* Player - personal notes visible only to you.
* Shared - notes shared between you and the admins.
* Admin - notes about you visible only to admins.

`notes <section>` - Shows your notes.

`notes/set <section>=<notes>` - Sets notes.
`notes/edit <section>` - Grabs notes into your edit buffer.  (See [Edit Feature](/help/edit)).

Admins can also set admin-visible notes on players.  See [Manage Notes](/help/manage_notes) for details.
