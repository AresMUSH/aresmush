# Dice Roller

The dice command is used to roll random dice.  The syntax is <numDice>d<dieSides>.  

For example: 4d6 would roll four six-sided dice.

A coin flip can be simulated using 1d2 with a result of '1' meaning heads and '2' meaning tails.

`dice <die string>` - Rolls dice and shows the results to your room.
`dice/private <die string` - Rolls dice but only shows the results to yourself.
