# Echo Text

The echo command is used to send text back to yourself.  You might use this to remember something, or to repeat a pose that you missed in a log.

`echo <text>`
  
You can also use the echo command to show text to the room you're in.  Unlike an emit, this will be tagged with your name and the text will not be evaluated for any formatting codes.  This is similar to the 'train' command on other MU servers, and is useful for teaching people how to execute commands.

`echo/room <text>`
