# Accessibility Support

Ares is meant for everyone.

If you use a screen reader, you can let Ares know by turning on screen reader mode.  When screen reader mode is enabled, the game will omit things like border lines.

`screenreader <on or off>` - Enables or disables screen reader mode.
  
If you have difficulty seeing color, you can change how the game shows you colors.  You can choose FANSI (256 colors), regular ansi (16 colors), or none (grayscale).

`colors <fansi, ansi, none>` - Changes what colors you see.

If you have a player handle, you can set these settings once in your AresCentral account and it will automatically carry over to all your other linked characters.  See [AresCentral](/help/arescentral).

Suggestions for improving accessibility are always welcome.  Just [contact us](https://aresmush.com/feedback.html).
