# Beep

The beep command will send a terminal "bell" code to your client.  In some clients, this will create an audible beep.  (Beeps are not supported in all MU clients.)

`beep`

> Note: This command only affects your own client; there is no command to beep someone else's client.

Some people like to use beeps in conjunction with client-side event triggers. For example, you can set up a trigger in your client:

- When the client sees "It's your turn to pose."
- Send "beep" command to the game.

This will create an audible alert when it's your turn to pose.
