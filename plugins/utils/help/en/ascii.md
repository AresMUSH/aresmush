# ASCII Support

Ares supports UTF8 Unicode strings by default, which allows it to work in multiple languages.  Most clients support this, though you might need to enable it.  You can find tips for configuring common clients in the [Client Setup Tutorial](arescentral_url: http://arescentral.aresmush.com).

If your client cannot support UTF8, you may see garbled characters on the screen.  You can clean this up somewhat by enabling ASCII-Only Mode in Ares.  The game will convert smart quotes to straight quotes and any other non-ASCII characters to "?".

`ascii <on or off>`
  
> Note!  If you have a player handle (help handles), you can set your autospace and quote color preferences once on AresCentral and that setting will carry over to all your Ares games.
