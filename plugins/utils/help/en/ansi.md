# Ansi Color
You create a color in Ares using either \%x or \%c followed by the color code.  \%xn goes back to normal.  

For example: \%xgGreen\%xn makes %xgGreen%xn.  

Ares supports the standard Penn/Tiny color codes (g, b, c, etc.) as well as extended codes for FANSI support (http://www.fansi.org).  FANSI allows 256 colors, but it its not supported on all clients.

You can change how the game shows you colors.  You can choose FANSI (256 colors), regular ansi (16 colors), or none.

`colors <fansi, ansi, none>` - Changes what colors you see.
`colors` - View all color codes as they appear in your client.

Ansi codes can be nested within each other.

  \%xrRed on black\%xBRed on Blue\%xnBack to normal
  %xrRed on black%xBRed on Blue%xnBack to normal

And codes like bold and underline can be stacked with other colors.

  \%xh\%xbHighlighted blue.\%xn
  %xh%xbHighlighted blue.%xn

Additional ansi codes include:

    \%x! - A random color
    \%xu - Start underline
    \%xU - End underline (but doesn't end any colors)
    \%xi - Inverse colors
    \%xI - End inverse
    \%xh - Highlight color (bold)
    \%xH - End bold (but doesn't end any colors)
