# Emoji Support

Ares supports standard [Unicode Emoji](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html).  You can use emoji with codes like:

    `:grin:`
    `:cowboy:`

You can see a full list on the web portal - just click the 'emoji help' button next to the chat or scene command windows or visit the [emoji page](/emoji) on your web portal.  Selected smileys are also converted to emoji.  

Some MUSH clients may not be able to display emoji.  If your client cannot display any Unicode/UTF-8 characters at all, you probably want to turn on [ASCII Mode](/help/ascii). If you just have trouble with emoji, you can turn them off without affecting other special characters.

`emoji <on or off>` - Turns emoji display on or off.
  
Note that the emoji command only affects your MUSH client display output. The web portal will always display emoji.
