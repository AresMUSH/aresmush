# Creating Command Shortcuts

You can create your own shortcuts for commands.  

`shortcuts` - List your shortcuts.
`shortcut/add <shortcut>=<command>` - Adds a shortcut.
`shortcut/delete <shortcut>` - Removes a shortcut.

For example, if you want the game to do the 'combat' command whenever you type 'com', or 'help' every time you typed 'h', you would add a shortcut like this:

    shortcut/add com=combat
    shortcut/add h=help

You can include arguments in your shortcuts.  For example, you could create an alias that did 'help combat' when you typed `chelp`.

    shortcut/add chelp=help combat

When you use a shortcut, anything you type after it will be added to the end of the command.  Here's one that lets you do `pf <text>` to page Faraday.

    shortcut/add pf=page faraday=
