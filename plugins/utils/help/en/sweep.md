# Sweeping a Room

The sweep command can be used to see what disconnected players are in your room.  You can also kick them out to keep them from connecting into the middle of a private scene.  Kicking will also remove players who are more than an hour idle.

`sweep` - Show disconnected players.
`sweep/kick` - Kick disconnected and idle players outside.
