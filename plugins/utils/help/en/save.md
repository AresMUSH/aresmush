# Save and Recall Text

The save and recall commands are handy when you're in the middle of typing something and need to save it for a moment to do something else - like answer a page or respond on channel.  You can `save` the text you were typing, do something else, and then `recall` the text when you're done.

Your client must be set up to support input grabbing for the recall command to work right.  See [Grabbing and Editing Text](/help/edit) for more information.

`save` - Saves some text for later.  You can have five things saved.
`recall` - Lists the text available for recall.
`recall <#>` - Recalls some text into your input buffer.
