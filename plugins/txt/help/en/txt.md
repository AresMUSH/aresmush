# Holonet Text Messaging aka HoloTxt
This command is to be used for In-Character communication. A HoloTxt is sent over the planetary HoloNet, from one person to another, via datapad of whatever sort. This works much like real-life texting.

> Note: HoloTxts are not perfectly secure! This is a well-known fact in-game. Txting can be monitored staff for RP purposes.

`txt <target>=<message>` - Send a message to target.
`txt =<message>` - Send a message to your last target.

`txt <target>/<scene #>=<message>` - Send a text to a target + log it into a scene.

`txt/color <color>` - Color the (Txt) prefix. Use ansi color format for this, ex: \%xh\%xr for red highlight, \%xh\%xg for green highlight.

> If you do not wish to receive txts (in general, or from a specific person), the `page/ignore <name>=<on/off>` and `page/dnd <on/off>` commands will block txts as well.

(More commands are planned! But for now, this is what we got.)
