# Events

The events system is an in-game calendar that lets you schedule events.

## Scheduling Events

You can create and edit your own events.  Characters with the `manage_events` permission can edit other peoples' events too.  

> **Note:** All events are public. You can note in a description if an event is limited in who can participate.

When creating an event, you set its date, time, description, and an optional content warning.

> **Note:** Event times must be specified in the **server's** timezone.  This will be automatically converted to local time for anyone who has their timezone set. The [OOC Time](/help/ooc_time) will tell you the server timezone.

## Event Display

You can view upcoming events on the web portal (in the sidebar or by clicking the 'All Events' link) or the `events` command.

In the MU Client display, events are color-coded based on how close they are.

* Green = within 24 hours
* Yellow = within 48 hours
* Bold = within 7 days

## Signing Up For Events

You can indicate your interest in an event by signing up (aka RSVP-ing) for it.  You can view a list of signups in the event details.

> **Note:** Ultimately it is up to the event organizer how to handle signups: first-come-first-served, best-fitting characters, lottery, etc.  It's best to set expectations in the events description.

## Calendar Feed

On the events page in the web portal, you'll find a link to the game's iCalendar feed.  If you're using an iCalendar-compatible calendar app like Outlook or Apple iCal, you can add the game's iCal feed to your app and it will automatically load events into your calendar.
