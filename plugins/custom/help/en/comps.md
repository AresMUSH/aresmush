#Comps
Comps are a fun way to tell people what you like about them or their RP. Comps should always be positive. Please report any abuse.

`comp <name> [<name> <name>]=<message>` - Leave a compliment for someone
`comp <scene #>=<message>` - Leave a compliment for everyone in a scene
`comps [<name>]` - See someone's compliments

Giving someone a comp also gives them a cookie, if you have not already done so this week.
