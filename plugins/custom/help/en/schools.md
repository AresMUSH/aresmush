# Schools
Schools reflect the type of spells a magic user is able to do. A magic user may have an affinity for a single School, or they may possess an affinity for two, one lesser and one greater. System-wise, Schools function in the same way as action skills, governing how well a caster performs a particular spell.

There are eight schools: Air, Corpus, Earth, Fire, Nature, Spirit, Water, Will

 See [Schools](http://spiritlakemu.com/wiki/magic) for more info.

`school/set <name>=<major/minor>/<school>` - Set a school on a character and sets their matching skill to 1 (minor) or 2(major).
`schools <name>` - Show schools for a character.
