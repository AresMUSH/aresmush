# Secrets
Secrets are admin-created pieces of information about your character, which your character may or may not be aware of. They are hooks for plots and story development over time.

You can set your secret preferences during CG to let admin know whether you're interested in secrets.

`secrets [<name>]` - View someone's secrets.

## Admin Commands

`secrets/set <name>=<secret name>/<secret_summary>` - Set a secret on a character.
