#Death
Although we strive to keep characters playable as players prefer, note that there is a chance of unplanned character death. During combat, if a character is KO'd, they have up to three rounds to receive magical healing or first aid treatment. If they do not, they may spend a Luck Point (`combat/hero`) to stay alive and re-enter the fight. Otherwise, the character will bleed out and die.

**Admin Only**
`death/undo` - Resurrects a character who has died.
