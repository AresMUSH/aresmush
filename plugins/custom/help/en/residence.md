##Newcomers to Grand Lake

Those newly arrived in Grand Lake have a variety of options available to them. There are a number of inns, hotels, lodges, and B&Bs in town that cater to tourists. We suggest the PC-run Ivy House Inn, a small B&B on the lake.

We are happy to build you a private room or give you ownership of a pre-existing room in any of these locations. Feel free to use the real Grand Lake as inspiration for locations.

To get a room, do `build/request <room name>=<details>`. Include where it should be built and any other needed info.

##Medium-term Residents of Grand Lake

So you were new, but you've decided to stick around. Great! Grand Lake is a small town with a sluggish real estate market and no apartment complexes to speak of. That means that it can be hard to find a good place to live.

Some options:
* Stay on at the B&B or a hotel, if you can afford it.
* Take a room at the Spirit Lake Cottages. They seem to take a shine to folks who decide to stick around for a while, and many magic users have ended up there. The owners cut magic users who've been in town for a while a steep discount - but you may have to share a cottage with others.
* Buy a mobile home. There's a small trailer park in Grand Lake, and it's cheaper than a house.
* Buy an RV. There are several campgrounds with RV hook-ups for less than a house costs. Of course, it gets cold in the winter.
* Buy a house that fits within your means. The real estate market isn't hopping, but it DOES exist. Feel free to find one that works for you.

We don't police where you live, so pick something that makes sense for your IC situation and sounds fun.

To get a room, house, mobile home, RV, etc, do `build/request <room name>=<details>`. Include where it should be built and any other needed info.
