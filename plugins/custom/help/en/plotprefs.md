#Plot Preferences
Plot preferences are a tool meant to help player GMs run PRPs.

They can help GMs know what you love to play, and what you prefer to avoid. They can be specific (I really want to ride a unicorn!) or general (I prefer plots that aren't heavy on investigation). You can use them to suggest themes you'd like to explore, how you feel about GMs using NPCs in your character's life, your comfort level with violence or gore, magical creatures or worlds that really interest you, and more.

GMs are not bound by plot preferences, so adding something there doesn't mean that you'll get exactly what you list, but they can help spark ideas and might end up leading to some great story.

`plotprefs/set <plot preferences>` - Set your plot preferences. You can use line breaks and markdown.
`plotprefs [<name>]` - See someone's plot preferences
