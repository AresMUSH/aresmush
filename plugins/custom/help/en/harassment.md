#Harassment and Bad Behavior

We do not tolerate harassment on Spirit Lake. This includes (but is not limited to) inappropriate sexual, racial, or gender-based remarks, as well as any continued attention or communication that persists after someone has asked that you refrain.

If you feel that someone is exhibiting bad behavior or is being harassing, please don't hesitate to inform admin. Logged proof makes the situation easier to deal with, but we take all complaints seriously. Ares has a number of tools to auto-log and report poor behavior, and we encourage you to use these **even in borderline cases**. This makes it easier to track trends and act on long-term problems.

##Channel tools
`channel/report <channel>=<explanation>`

##PM tools
`page/ignore <name>=<on or off>` - Blocks a character from sending you private messages.
`page/review <conversation>` - Review a PM conversation.
`page/report <conversation>=<range>/<reason> - Creates a report.` - Creates a job report, including your page log as evidence. 'Range' determines which pages are included.

##Mail tools
`mail/report <#>=<explanation>` - Reports an offensive mail message.

##Booting players
This is a last-resort, but all players are empowered to boot truly problematic players who are engaging in harassment or extremely bad behavior. Using this command creates a job so that admin is always aware of the activity.

`boot <name>=<reason>` - Boots a player from the game and creates a job.

##Admin tools
`statue <name>=<reason>` - Freezes a character, rendering them unable to use any commands at all - not even to quit.
`app/unapprove <name>` - Unapprove a character
