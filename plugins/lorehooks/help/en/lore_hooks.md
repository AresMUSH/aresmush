# Lore Hooks
Lore Hooks are bits of fun lore that are unique to you.

You can set your Lore Hook preferences during CG to let admin know what sort of hook you would like. You can choose Magical Creature Ancestry, Magical Creature Pet, or Magical Item.

Each hook comes with a brief lore write-up that your character can discover through exploration or research, as well as tangible effects you can RP around. [Lore Hooks](/lore-hooks) are visible on the web portal.

## Commands
`lorehook/preference <type>` - Set your lore hook preference.  Types are ancestry, pet, or item. You can also chose 'none' for no hook or 'storyteller' to have STs choose for you.
`lorehook/preference <name>` - View someone's lore hook preference.
`lorehook/preference all` - View everyone's lore hook preference.

If you have further preferences, you can list them in your plot preferences on your character page. Generally, STs will create something that we think will be interesting for your character and that fits into the story, but we'll keep preferences in mind where possible.

See the [Guide to Lore Hooks](https://tinyurl.com/y6zgez98) for more info on each type of hook.

## Admin Commands
`lorehook/set <name>=<lore hook name>/<lore hook desc>` - Set a lore hook on a character. <name> should be `<creature> Ancestry`, `<creature> Pet`, or `<magical item>`
`lorehook/type <name>=<lore hook type>` - Set a lore hook's type on a character. Types are ancestry, pet, or item.
