# Who's Online

`who` - Shows which other players are connected to the game and information about them.
`where` - Shows character locations on the grid.
`where/ic` - Only show people who are IC.
`where/friends` - Only show where your friends are.
`scenes` - Shows active scenes and who is in them.
`hide` and `unhide` - Controls whether your location shows up on the who and live scenes lists.

`who <search>` or `where <search>` - Search for characters whose name starts with or matches a particular string.

## Who Status

Your character status is a general reflection of what you're doing on the game.  It shows up on the who list and can affect other commands as well.

    AFK (Away from the Keyboard) - You can set this by doing `AFK [<note>]`
    IC (In an In Character area, aka "Onstage")
    OOC (In an Out of Character area, aka "Offstage")
    NEW (A new character who has not been approved or has marked themselves as a beginner)
    ADM (Admin on duty; off-duty admins show up as OOC)

IC/OOC status is determined by where you are.  Some rooms are IC areas; others are OOC.

`whois <name>` - Quickly look up a character's fullname and other info based on part of their full name, MU* character name or a nickname.
