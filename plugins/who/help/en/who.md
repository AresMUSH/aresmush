# Who's Online

The `who` command shows you which other players are connected to the game and information about them.

`who` - Shows the who list.
`who <search>` or `where <search>` - Search the who list.

## Where

The `where` command shows you who's online and where they are.

`where` - Shows the who list including character locations.
`where/ic` - Only show people who are IC.
`where/friends` - Only show where your friends are.
`hide` and `unhide` - Controls whether your grid location shows up on the who/where list and live scene list.

> **Note:** There is no way in Ares to completely omit yourself from the who list or room descriptions (i.e. no dark power.)

## Who Status

Your character status is a general reflection of what you're doing on the game.  It shows up on the who list and can affect other commands as well.

    AFK (Away from the Keyboard)
    IC (In an In Character area, aka "Onstage")
    OOC (In an Out of Character area, aka "Offstage")
    WEB (Character playing from web portal)
    NEW (A new character who has not been approved or has marked themselves as a beginner)
    ADM (Admin on duty; off-duty admins show up as OOC)

IC/OOC status is determined by where you are.  Some rooms are IC areas; others are OOC.
