# Who's Online

The `who` command shows you which other players are connected to the game and information about them.

`who` - Shows the who list.
`where` - Shows the who list including character locations.
`hide` and `unhide` - Controls whether your location shows up on the who list and live scene list.
      There is no way in Ares to completely omit yourself from the who list or room descriptions (i.e. no dark power.)

## Who Status

Your character status is a general reflection of what you're doing on the game.  It shows up on the who list and can affect other commands as well.

    AFK (Away from the Keyboard)
    IC (In an In Character area, aka "Onstage")
    OOC (In an Out of Character area, aka "Offstage")
    NEW (A new character who has not been approved or has marked themselves as a beginner)
    ADM (Admin on duty; off-duty admins show up as OOC)

IC/OOC status is determined by where you are.  Some rooms are IC areas; others are OOC.

## Searching the Who List

You can also search who and where for characters whose name starts with or matches a particular string.

`who <search>` or `where <search>`
  
## Filtering Where List

The where command has a few modes to help you narrow down what you see.

`where/ic` - Only show people who are IC.
`where/friends` - Only show where your friends are.

## Who Is Someone?

The whois command lets you quickly look up a person's fullname and other info based on part of their full name, MU* character name or a nickname such as a callsign (if enabled).

`whois <name>`
