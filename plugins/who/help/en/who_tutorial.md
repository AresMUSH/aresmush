# Who's Online

There are several ways to find out who's online and what they're doing.

On the web portal, the Who's Online page will show you the currently-connected players and their general status (active or inactive, web portal or game/MU client).

From the MU client, the `who` command gives the same basic information, along with connected/idle times, groups, and more.  The specific information varies by game.

    +==~~~~~====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~=====~~~~=====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~~==+
                                      Ares Test

## Who Status Legend

* AFK (Away from the Keyboard)
* IC (In an In Character area, aka "Onstage")
* OOC (In an Out of Character area, aka "Offstage")
* WEB (Character playing from web portal)
* NEW (A new character who has not been approved or has marked themselves as a beginner)
* ADM (Admin on duty; off-duty admins show up as OOC)

IC/OOC status is determined by where you are.  Some rooms are IC areas; others are OOC.

## Where and Scenes

When playing on a MU client, you're bound to rooms in the grid and it can be important to know where people are.  The `where` command will show you:

    +==~~~~~====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~=====~~~~=====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~~==+
                                   Ares Local Test                                
    -----[ Open Scenes ]----------------------------------------------------------
    #951  North - North/Iceland              Faraday Flare[Web]
    
    -----[ Other ]----------------------------------------------------------------
          Offstage - Quiet Room              Cate
          Web Portal                         Ryan[Web]
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            3 Online                    1 IC                    6 Record         
    +==~~~~~====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~=====~~~~=====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~====~~~~~==+

Depending on the game configuration, the where list may also highlight open scenes that you can join.  See [Scenes](/help/scenes_tutorial).  Characters playing from the web portal are indicated with `[Web]`.
