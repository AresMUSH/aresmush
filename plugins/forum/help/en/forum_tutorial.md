# Forum Tutorial

Inspired by the widely-loved [Myrrdinâ€™s Bulletin Board System](http://www.firstmagic.com/~merlin/mushcode/mc.bb.html), the Ares Forum provides MU-wide discussion topics, available in-game (via the `forum` command) and on the web portal (typically under Play -> Forum).

Discussions are divided into **categories**, such as game announcements, IC happenings, or event coordination. The specific list will vary by game, so check the forum for details. 

Some forums are restricted to players with certain roles.  When you view the forum list, you'll see whether you have read and/or write access.  If you have write access to a category, you can post new topics and replies to existing topics.

You can scan for new forum posts when you log in using `forum/scan`.  Hide categories that don't interest you, so you won't be bothered by notifications about them.  Topics will automatically be marked read when you look at them, or you can clear the unread notifications all at once with the "Mark All Read" button on the web portal or the `forum/catchup` command.
