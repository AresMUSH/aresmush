# OOC Asides

You can make out-of-character (OOC) asides to the other room occupants.  The same pose shortcuts (", :, etc.) apply with OOC asides.  It defaults to a 'say' if you don't specify anything.

`ooc Hi!` - <OOC> Bob says, "Hi!"
`ooc :waves.` - <OOC> Bob waves.
   
Note: If you're looking for the way to go OOC, you're probably looking for the `offstage` command.
