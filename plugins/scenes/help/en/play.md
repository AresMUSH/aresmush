# Play Screen

The web portal's [Play Screen](/play) is the preferred way to play through the web portal. Here you can access all your scenes, channels, and private messages (pages). 

If your characters are linked through your AresCentral [player handle](/help/arescentral), you will see your scenes/channels/PMs for them all together. If you prefer to manage your characters separately, you can go to [account settings](/account) and turn off "Unified Play Screen".  (This setting is managed separately for each character.)
