# Pose Order

Pose order tracking is a tool to help you keep track of whose turn it is.  This is a guide to help people take turns equitably, and is not meant as a strict turn order.

`pose/order` - Shows the pose order of the room.
`pose/nudge <on, off or gag>` - Controls whether the game tells you when it's your turn.
`pose/drop <name>` - Skips someone's turn if they're idle. As soon as they pose again, they'll jump in at their new spot.

For large scenes, you can switch from regular order to 3-pose order, where someone can pose again after three other people have posed.

`pose/ordertype <normal, 3-per>`
