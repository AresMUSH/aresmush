# Formatting Poses

AresMUSH provides a few commands to help make poses and emits more readable.

The autospace command automatically inserts a blank line or other characters between poses, to help you tell where one ends and the next begins.  This is particularly helpful when there are multi-paragraph poses.  Autospace can contain formatting codes and `%n` to include the poser's name.

`autospace <text>` - Sets your autospace text.  Leave blank to clear it.
  
> Note: This applies only to poses.  There is another command (see [Pages](/help/page)) that lets you format a similar autospace before pages and OOC remarks.

You can also have Ares colorize text between quotes in poses, to make quotations more visible.  The color code can be found in the `colors` command.  You can also combine colors, so \%xb\%xh will make it bold and blue.

`quotecolor <ansi color code>` - Sets your quotation color.  Leave blank to clear it.

> Note: If you have a player handle (help handles), you can set your autospace and quote color preferences once on AresCentral and that setting will carry over to all your Ares games.
