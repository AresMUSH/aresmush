# FFG Character Creation System

The FFG game system in use here is a blend of Gensys and Star Wars FFG. Some things are different, and so this will walk you through what all you need to know.

For a thorough walk-through, please see: LINK

Your **concept** should already be set. Your **background** will be set later. We do not use **obligation or duty**.

> **Note!** All chargen commands can be used at any time after you set your archetype and career. These screens are simply to guide you through the process and make sure you do not miss anything.

> **XP!** Beyond your first specialization, everything will subtract XP, and the code *will not* tell you how much XP is being subtracted as it does it. For your initial 4 skills, this *will* cost XP. Your archetype has been granted extra XP to make up for this. Use `sheet` to view how much XP you currently have.

## Archetype and Careers

**Archetype** is your character's **species**. This determines your starting characteristics, XP, some talents and other things, etc.

We are using many species, from a multitude of books. Use `archetypes` to see a long, spammy list of available species, or visit here for a cleaner list: http://chontio.aresmush.com/wiki/species_chart

**Career** is not just your job, but the heart of your character. It defines who they are and how they react to any given situation. Regardless of who Luke Skywalker became, he was an Ace, and that informs the way he handles situations. You career cannot change. Careers give access to specializations (next step) and discounts on buying certain career skills.

We use the careers from Age of Rebellion only. Use `careers` to see the list of **careers** and **specialties**. 

To set your archetype and career, use `select <archetype>/<career>`.

### Commands:

`sheet` - Display your character sheet.

`archetypes` - Lists available Archetypes/Species (Warning: Spammy)
`careers` - Lists available careers, career skills, and specializations
`select <archetype>/<career>` - Sets your archetype and career.
`reset <archetype>/<career>` - Exact same as select.
> Note! Using `select` will reset your character sheet entirely.
