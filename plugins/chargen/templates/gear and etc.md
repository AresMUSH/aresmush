## Gear and Etc

We do not use **motivations**. Characters will set **RP hooks**, which will fulfill a somewhat similar function. Those will be added later. 

**Staring gear** will also be handled uniquely to this setting. Please see THIS PAGE for instructions. For those that do not want to mess about with gear, simply add a comment to the job that's produced saying you will take the standard gear set. Staff will make sure you get something appropriate to your career.

**Credits** are not used here. Please see `help Credits` for information about credits.
