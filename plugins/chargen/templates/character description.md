# Description

Everything has a description! It's the thing you get when you `look` at someone or something. It's not quite as important here, as your basic features show up on your profile. But it is still important!

## Set your Description

You can set a description on yourself.  

`describe me=<description>` - Describes yourself

If your client supports the Edit Feature (/help/edit), you can use the edit command to grab the existing description into your client's input buffer.

`describe/edit me` - Grabs the existing description into your input buffer.

## Set your Short Desc

Characters have a short description that shows up in things like the glance command and the character list in room descriptions.  You set this separately from your main desc.

`shortdesc me=<description>` - Sets your short desc.
`shortdesc/edit <name>` - Grabs an existing short desc into your input buffer.

## Outfits and Details

You can store multiple descriptions with the [Outfits](/help/outfits) commands, and have expanded [Details](/help/details) (like jewelry or tatoos).
