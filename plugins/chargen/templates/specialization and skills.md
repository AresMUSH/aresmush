## Specialization and Skills

**Specialization** is a further refining of your career. Specializations grant you access to **talents** and gives you additional **career skills**. Use `careers` to see a list of careers and specializations. Choose one from within your career.

You may pick additional specializations, but these will cost xp: 10 times the number you will have, plus an additional 10 if it is not within your career. (So, if you have 1, your second would cost 10 * 2 = 20, plus 10 if outside your career).

**Skills** are things you are trained in. You must have four career skills set to at least 1. Use `app` to see how many career skills have been taken. Use `skills` to see a list of skills, or see here: LINK

> Note: All skills cost XP, even the 4 starting skills. You've already been granted xp to accomodate that. If your **archetype**/**species** grants you free skills, you start with extra xp to purchase those skills.

You may set skills higher or choose non-career skills at the cost of XP. That will be explained in the next screen.
