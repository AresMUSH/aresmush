## Spending XP:

XP can be spent to raise or add the following:

**Characteristics** - Characteristics are set based on your archetype. They may be increased now, at the cost of 10x the new level. Characteristics can be raised with XP *only* during character creation.

**Skills** - Career skills cost 5x the new level, non-career skills cost 10x.

**Talents** - Careers grant access to talents. Talents use the Genesys "pyramid" model, instead of the maze-like Star Wars model. That means to have a tier 2 talent, you must have at least two tier 1 talents. For more information, see here: LINK

Talents cost 5x the tier that is being purchased.

For a list of talents, use `talents` or see here: LINK
