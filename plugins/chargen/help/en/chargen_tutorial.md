# Character Creation

Character creation, or chargen, is where you set up your character's basic information and stats, depending on what skills system your game has in place.

## Web and Game Chargen

On some games, you can complete chargen entirely on the web portal (typically under Play -> Create a Character).

Even if your game doesn't support web chargen fully, you can still set up your basic information on the portal and do the rest from a MU client.  The `cg` command will walk you through the necessary steps.  

Chargen consists of several stages.  You can go back and forth through the stages of chargen as much as you need to.

> **Tip:** When doing chargen on the MU client, your changes are immediately saved with every command. On the web portal, you must click "Save" to save your character.

## Apps

The `app` command is your friend during chargen.  It will alert you to things you may have forgotten to set.  %xrred%xn issues will almost certainly prevent your character from being approved (like forgetting to set your eye color).  %xyYellow%xn issues are warnings; they might actually be OK if it fits the character concept.

Once you're happy with your character, you can submit it for review.  Game admin will make sure it's a good fit for the game's theme, that the skills are reasonable given the background, and that you haven't missed anything important in chargen.

You can't make further changes while your app is under review.  If you realize you need to change something, you can withdraw or un-submit your application.  The app will be on hold while you make the necessary changes, and you can use the submit command again when you're done.
