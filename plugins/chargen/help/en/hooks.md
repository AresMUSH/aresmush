# Setting Roleplay Hooks

RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can "hook" into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a job, a family relationship, a reputation your character has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you.  Looking around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP Hooks.

`hooks` - View your hooks.
`hooks <name>` - View someone else's hooks.
`hooks/edit` - Grabs the existing RP Hook text into your input buffer.  (See [Edit Feature](/help/edit)).
You can also edit your hooks on the Web Portal by visiting your character page and choosing 'edit' from the bottom menu.

Admins with the `manage_apps` permission can set other peoples' hooks:

`hooks/set <name>=<hooks>` and `hooks/edit <name>`
