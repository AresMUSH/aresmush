# Setting Roleplay Hooks 

RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can "hook" into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you. This is also a good place to list your character's **motivations**. Looking around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP Hooks.  RP hooks are a freeform text field.  

`hooks` - View your hooks.
`hooks/set <hooks>` - Set your hooks.  Leave blank to clear them. Note: you can use **markdown** here.
`hooks <name>` - View someone else's hooks.

> Note: Information provided in hooks is generally safe for using as IC knowledge.

If your client supports the [Edit Feature](/help/edit), you can use the edit command to grab a RP hook into the input buffer.

`hooks/edit` - Grabs the existing RP Hook text into your input buffer.

Admins with the `manage_apps` permission can set other peoples' hooks:

`hooks/set <name>=<hooks>` and `hooks/edit <name>`
