# Setting Roleplay Hooks 

RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can "hook" into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you.  Looking around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP Hooks.

`hook/add <title>=<description>` and `hook/remove <title>`

Admins with the `manage\_apps` permission can set other peoples' hooks:

`hook/add <name>=<hook name>/<description>`
`hook/remove <name>=<hook name>`
