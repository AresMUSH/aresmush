# Setting Roleplay Hooks

RP Hooks are interesting things about your character that others can "hook" into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a job, a family relationship, a reputation your character has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you.  Looking around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP Hooks.

`hooks` - View your hooks.
`hooks <name>` - View someone else's hooks.

You can edit your hooks on the Web Portal by visiting your character page and choosing 'edit' from the bottom menu.
