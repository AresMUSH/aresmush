# Backgrounds

The most important part of a character is their background. We are not looking for a novel, just a couple paragraphs describing the characterâ€™s backstory.  In particular, your background should cover:

* Who is your character?
* Why are they here?
* Anything noteworthy about your character, particularly things that explain unusual expertise or interests.

The easiest way to edit your background is to type it in an offline program, like notepad, and paste it in.  You can use \%R to separate paragraphs.

`bg/set <background>` - Sets your background.  
`bg` - Views your background.

> **Tip: Why can't I break up my super-long BG into pages?** It's OK if your bg scrolls a little off-screen, but basically - we don't need or want super-long BGs. If you can't condense the information into a manageable size, then chances are you have too many super-special things in your background or you're going into too much detail.  You are more than welcome to provide supplemental character information on the game wiki, but the BG system isn't the place for it.  

If your client supports the [Edit Feature](/help/edit), you can use the edit command to grab your background text into the input buffer.

`bg/edit` - Grabs the existing background text into your input buffer.

Once your character has been approved, you will no longer be able to edit your background.  Contact the admins if you need to make changes after approval.
