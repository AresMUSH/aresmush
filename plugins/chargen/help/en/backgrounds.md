# Backgrounds

Here on Chontio, we've attempted to keep backgrounds as simple as we can. We need three responses, which will be used to complete the following statement: *The Confederation is important to me because <#1>. I want to see it <#2> because <#3>.*

**#1** is your investment in the [Tageeri Confederation](/wiki/theme:Tageeri Confederation). It can be as complex or as simple as you'd like, but it should define a major motivation of your character.

**#2** is what you're fighting for: to see the Confederation succeed, see it join the Empire, see it grow rich.

**#3** is the future, and what the Confederation succeeding looks like to you.

You may enter this as two complete sentences or as a bullet list. We prefer one line for each (or equivalent). If you wish to expand further, please feel free, but limit each item to a paragraph. 

Example: The Confederation is important to me because it has brought prosperity to the city of Davotay. I want to grow fantastically rich by milking the Empire, because that's what the Empire is good for: taking from.

If you have not read any of the lore, please see [Getting Started](/wiki/Getting Started) to make sure you have the information you need to complete your background.

The easiest way to edit your background is to type it in an offline program, like notepad, and paste it in.  You can use \%R to separate paragraphs.

`bg/set <background>` - Sets your background.  
`bg` - Views your background.

> **Tip**: If your client supports the [Edit Feature](/help/edit), you can use the `bg/edit` command to grab your background text into the input buffer.

Once your character has been approved, you will no longer be able to edit your background. Contact the admins if you need to make changes after approval.
