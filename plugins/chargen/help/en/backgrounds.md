# Backgrounds

Backgrounds let you specify your character's backstory.  We are not looking for a novel, just a couple paragraphs covering things like:

* Who is your character?
* Why are they here?
* Anything noteworthy about your character, particularly things that explain unusual expertise or interests.

The easiest way to edit your background is to type it in an offline program, like notepad, and paste it in.  You can use \%R to separate paragraphs.

`bg/set <background>` - Sets your background.  
`bg` - Views your background.
`bg/edit` - Grabs the existing background text into your input buffer. (See [Edit Feature](/help/edit)).

Once your character has been approved, you will no longer be able to edit your background.  Contact the admins if you need to make changes after approval.
