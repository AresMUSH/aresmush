# Character Creation

You can do chargen either on the [Web Portal](/help/web_portal) or in-game.  They both have the same information - it's just a matter of preference.
 
You can access the chargen commands from anywhere on the game.  The chargen tutorial will prompt you step by step.

`cg/start` - Starts chargen.
`cg/next` and `cg/prev` - Navigates the stages in chargen.
`cg` - View the current chargen page again.
