Character creation (aka chargen) here works a little differently than what you might be used to from other games.  Instead of being a series of rooms, the %xccg%xn command will walk you through the necessary steps.  

Please read the chargen primer on the game wiki before you begin:

You can go back and forth through the steps of chargen as much as you want using %xccg/next%xn and %xccg/prev%xn.
