#Compliments
Comps are a fun way to tell people what you like about them or their RP. Comps should always be positive. Please report any abuse.

`comp <name> [<name> <name>]=<message>` - Leave a compliment for someone
`comps [<name>]` - See someone's compliments

`comp <scene #>=<message>` - Leave a compliment for everyone in a scene. Your game may have disabled this feature.

Giving someone a comp also gives both you and the recipient 1/4 of a luck point.
