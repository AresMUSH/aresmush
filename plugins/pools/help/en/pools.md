# Pool
This system is designed to allow players to track a pool of points that can be spent or added. Each game can use this pool differently, but a good example would be a pool of energy you use to cast a spell. When you run out, maybe you can't cast anymore spells. The system is generic to be applied however you need to.

`pool` - Shows your Reserves.
`pool/show` - Show your Reserve level to the room/scene.
`pool/spend <amount>=<reason>` - Spends X pool point.
`pool/add <amount>=<reason>` - Adds X pool points.
`pool/set <amount>=<reason>` - Sets your pool to a value.
`pool/reset <amount>=<reason>` - Sets your pool to its default value.
`pool/desperate <amount>=<reason>` - Spends 6 pool points (drops you to 0 if 6 doesn't do that) for a large effect.
