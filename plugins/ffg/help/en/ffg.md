# FFG System

This game uses a simplified implementation of the [Fantasy Flight Games System](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/index/), used in the generic Genesys system and the various Star Wars RPGs (Edge of Empire, Age of Rebellion and Force and Destiny).

The FFG RPG system is copyright by Fantasy Flight Publishing.  You'll need a copy of the rulebook to get the full rules set and all of the talent effects.
