# FFG Abilities

FFG has three kinds of abilities:  Characteristics, Skills and Talents.

* Characteristics represent basic abilities all characters possess.  They're rated from 1-5, with 2 representing average human ability.
* Skills represent training and knowledge.  They're also rated from 1-5, with 2 representing basic competence.
* Talents are special abilities or tricks that a character can use to do cool feats.  Some talents are rated from 1-5; others you either have or don't have.

> Note: Talents use the FFG Gensys model of a 'balanced' talent pyramid instead of the FFG Star Wars' maze-like talent tree.  Individual specializations may not get talents in exactly the same order or at the same cost compared to classic FFG Star Wars.

Skills and talents are influenced by your character's career.  Some careers allow *specializations*, which further focus your character's skills.  You can have multiple specializations.

`archetypes` - Lists archetypes.
`careers` - Lists careers.
`reset <archetype>/<career>` - Sets your career and archetype.
    Note: Since costs, etc. are based on career/archetype, doing this will reset your character.

`specialization/add <name>` - Adds a specialization.
`specialization/remove <name>` - Removes a specialization.

`charac` - Lists characteristics.
`charac/set <name>=<rating>` - Sets a characteristic.

`skills` - Lists skills.
`skill/set <name>=<rating>` - Sets a skill.

`talents` - Lists talents.
`talents/spec <specialization>` - Lists only talents that are available to a given specialization.
`talent/add <name>` - Adds a talent.  Adding a ranked talent more than once increases its rank.
`talent/remove <name>` - Removes a talent.  Removing a ranked talent decreases its rank.
