`xp/award <name>=<points>` - Awards experience points to a character.
`story/award <name>=<points>` - Awards story points to a character.

`characteristic/set <name>=<ability name>/<rating>` - Sets a characteristic.
`skill/set <name>=<ability name>/<rating>` - Sets a skill.
`talent/add <name>=<talent name>` - Adds a talent.
`talent/remove <name>=<talent name>` - Removes a talent.

`force/set <name>=<force rating>` - Set someone's force rating.
`wound/set <name>=<wound thresh>` - Sets someone's wound threshold.
`strain/set <name>=<strain thresh>` - Sets someone's strain threshold.

Set a rating to 0 to remove an ability.
