Cookies are a fun way to appreciate your fellow players for playing with you.  Cookies are tallied and awarded weekly; you can only give someone a single cookie each week. You get a fraction of a luck point per cookie received.  

`cookie <list of names>` - Give a cookie.
`cookie/here` - Give cookies to everyone in the room (handy for big scenes).
`cookies/scene <scene number>` - Gives cookies to everyone in a scene (handy if you forget to cookie before people start leaving).
`cookies` - Sees cookies you have given out this week.
`cookies/total` - Shows how many cookies you've ever gotten.
