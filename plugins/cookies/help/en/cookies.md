# Cookies

Cookies are a fun way to appreciate your fellow players for playing with you.  Cookies are tallied and awarded weekly; you can only give someone a single cookie each week. You get a fraction of a luck point per cookie received.  

`cookie <list of names>` - Give a cookie.
`cookis/scene [<scene number>]` or `cookie/here` - Gives cookies to everyone in a scene (handy for big scenes, or if you forget to cookie before people start leaving).  You can leave off the scene number to use a scene you're in.
`cookies` - Sees cookies you have given out this week.
`cookies/total` - Shows how many cookies you've ever gotten.
