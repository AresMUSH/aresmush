# Achievement Commands

You can earn achievements for contributing to the game's community, story or website.  They have no practical effect; they're just fun badges for you to collect.

> Learn about how achievements work in the [Achievements Tutorial](/help/achievements_tutorial).

`achievements/all` - Lists all achievements.
`achievements` - Views your achievements.
`achievements <name>` Views someone else's achievements.
