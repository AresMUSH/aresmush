# Achievements Tutorial

You can earn achievements for contributing to the game's community, story or website.  They have no practical effect; they're just fun badges for you to collect.

Each game defines what achievements are available.  You can see a list of them on the Achievements page of the web portal (typically under System -> Achievements) or with the `achievements/all` command.  The Achievements page also summarizes who's earned which achievements.

Achievements are tracked per character.  You can see which ones you've earned on the "Achievements" tab of your character's web profile, or with the `achievements` command.  If one of your characters is marked as a [player bit](/help/playerbit), their web profile will show the collected achievements from all your characters.

Some achievements may be earned multiple times at different levels.  For instance, you will get the "Participated in 1 scenes." achievement for your very first scene, and it will be upgraded to "Participated in 10 scenes" after ten.
