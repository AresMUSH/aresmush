# Managing Achievements

> **Permission Required:** These commands require the Admin role or the permission: manage\_achievements

If you define custom achievements, you can award and remove them manually.

> Note: You can remove standard achievements but not award them.  

`achievement/add <character>=<achievement_name>` - Adds an achievement.
`achievement/remove <character>=<achievement_name>` - Removes an achievement.
  
You'll see the internal achievement names listed on `achievements <char>` when you view them with an admin char.  For example: If the achievement says, "Participated in a Social scene.  **(scene\_participant\_social)**", then you would use scene\_participant\_social to remove the achievement.
