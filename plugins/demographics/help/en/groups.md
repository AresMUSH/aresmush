# Groups

Groups represent your job and where you are from. All the options listed below are open to all characters, though your position in that group should be worked out with the head of that group. Please see [/wiki/theme:corporations](Corporations) and [/wiki/theme:government](Government) for more information on these groups, and [/wiki/theme:cities](Cities) for information on the cities of Chontio.

If you are interested in creating a new group and having it listed here, please contact staff. If you what to be part of a private group (that is not open to all characters), you should choose "Freelance" under Affiliation or Corporation.

Only admin may change your groups after you've been approved.

Available groups: Affiliation, Corporation, Government, Origin.

To see the choices in each group, please use `group <type>`, like such:
* `group Affiliation`: Your major affiliation in the city.
* `group Corporation`: Where do you work? These are the local corporations on Chontio.
* `group Government`: Government Agencies of the Tageeri Confederation
* `group Origin`: The city you're from.

To set up your group affiliation, you specify the group type and your desired option.

`group/set <group type>=<option>` - Sets your group option for a group type. **or**
`<group type> <choise>` - Ex: `Affiliation Tageeri`

> **Tip:** *Empire* is only available for NPCs. Please do not chose Empire.
