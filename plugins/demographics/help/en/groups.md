# Groups

During chargen, you can assign your character to various **Groups**.  Only admin may change your groups after you've been approved.

Different games will have different groups, like Department or Faction.  You can see a list of all group types and then look at what options exist for each type.

`groups` - List all group types.
`group <type>` - Shows options available for a group type.

To set up your group affiliation, you specify the group type and your desired option.

`group/set <group type>=<option>` - Sets your group option for a group type.

> **Tip:** Most games will have shortcuts set up for the different group types.  For example, if there's a faction group there will be a `factions` command to see faction options and a `faction <name>` command to set your faction.
