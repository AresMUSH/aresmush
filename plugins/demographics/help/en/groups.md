# Groups

During chargen, you can assign your character to various groups, like faction or department. The specific list will vary by game.

> Learn about groups in the [Demographics and Groups Tutorial](/help/demographics_tutorial).
  
`groups` - List all group types.
`group <type>` - Shows options available for a group type.
`group/set <group type>=<option>` - Sets your group option for a group type.

> **Tip:** Most games will have shortcuts set up for the different group types.  For example, if there's a faction group there will be a `factions` command to see faction options and a `faction <name>` command to set your faction.
