# Groups

During chargen, you can assign your character to various **Groups**.  Only admin may change your groups after you've been approved.

Available groups: Affiliation, Corporation, Government, Origin.

To see the choices in each group, please use `group <type>`, like such:
* `group Affiliation`: Your major affiliation in the city.
* `group Corporation`: Where do you work? These are the local corporations on Chontio.
* `group Government`: Government Agencies of the Tageeri Confederation
* `group Origin`: The city you're from.

To set up your group affiliation, you specify the group type and your desired option.

`group/set <group type>=<option>` - Sets your group option for a group type. **or**
`<group type> <choise>` - Ex: `Affiliation Tageeri`

> **Tip:** *Empire* is only available for NPCs. Please do not chose Empire.
