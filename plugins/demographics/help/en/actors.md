# Actors

It's fun to imagine the game as a TV show with actors playing the various characters.  You can see who's playing who and select an actor to "play" your character.

`actors` - Show taken actors.
`actors/search <name>` - Search the actors list.
`actor/set <name>` - Set your actor.  Leave blank to clear it.
