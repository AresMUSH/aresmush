# Census

You can use the census command to find out how many characters already exist with various criteria.

`census` - Lists all characters.

There's also a census to see a breakdown of characters by various groups or characteristics.  To see what census views are available, use:

`census/types` - See what census view types are available.
`census <type>` - Views a census.

FS3 games can also see a report of characters' skills.

`census skills <type>` - Shows a summary of skills.  Type can be Action, Background or Language.
