# Census

You can use the census command to find out how many characters already exist with various criteria.

`census` - Lists all characters.

There's also a census to see a breakdown of characters by gender, skills, or rank.

`census gender` - Counts characters by gender.
`census skills <type>` - Shows a summary of skills.  Type can be Action, Background or Language.
`census ranks` - Counts characters by rank.

You can also see a breakdown of characters from a particular group, like a faction.  See [Groups](/help/demographics/groups) for information about what groups are available.

`census <group>` - Counts characters by group.
