# Demographics and Groups

**Demographics** represent your basic character info, like their hair and eye color.  The specific list will vary from game to game.  You can view the available demographics using the `demographics` command or the web portal (typically under Play -> Create a Character -> Demographics).

You can also assign your character to various **Groups**, like Department or Faction.  These also vary from game to game.  You can view the available groups using the `groups` command or the web portal (typically under System -> Groups List).

> **Tip:** Most games will have shortcuts set up for the different group types.  For example, if there's a faction group there will be a `factions` command to see faction options and a `faction <name>` command to set your faction.

The main difference between groups and demographics is that groups show up in the [Census](/help/census) so you can see a breakdown of characters by group.  Also, groups have a fixed list of values whereas demographics are freeform.
