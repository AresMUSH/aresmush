The examples are:

1. outofthebox.rb                 - How to get started with minimal setup
2. simpleconfig.rb                - Using Log4r casually
3. moderateconfig.rb              - A more sophisticated config
4. xmlconfig.rb and moderate.xml  - XML configuration example based on #3
5. rrsetup.rb and rrconfig.xml    - A real example (or used to be ;-)
6. logserver.rb and logclient.rb  - Remote logging example
7. fileroll.rb                    - Using RollingFileOutputter
8. yaml.rb and log4r_yaml.yaml    - YAML configuration example

The output will go to screen and to files in the directory logs/.

Note to RubyGems users: The syntax to require log4r as a gem is as follows:

  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'log4r'

Obviously, the examples will need to be modified to follow this.
