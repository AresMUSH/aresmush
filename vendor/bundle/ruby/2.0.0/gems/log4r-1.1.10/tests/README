The unit tests are currently out of date. The examples actually provide
a decent test suite for log4r. But the unit tests are still very important
because of bounds-checking and a quicker turnaround for bug discovery.
The unit files need to be converted to the new 'test/unit' paradigm.

Because Log4r dynamically defines constants according to user preferences, 
the unit testing can't all be done in one instance of ruby. It is planned
to use popen to run each test that needs a clean ruby instance.

The logs/ directory is where these tests dump generated log files.
